BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the General Assembly encourages State employees to participate in the Stateâs 457(b) or 403(b) plan so that they can save, invest, and grow their retirement savings, and make their future retirement more secure, comfortable, and stress-free.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the General Assembly encourages parents to open and contribute to a DE529 account.

Parents who fund a 529 account when their children are very young usually enjoy greater returns and ultimately save more money for college. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the General Assembly encourages Delawareans with disabilities to open a DEPENDABLE account to securely save for the future. The General Assembly further encourages Delawareans who have a family member with a disability to open and contribute to a DEPENDABLE account on behalf of their loved one to help them achieve financial security and stability. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the General Assembly commits to supporting policies, initiatives, and solutions that incentivize Delawareans to save more for their future; expand access to savings plans and accounts; supplement Delawareansâ contributions to their savings accounts; and otherwise assist Delawareans with saving for retirement, higher education, homebuying, disability-related expenses, emergencies, and other needs. SYNOPSIS This resolution recognizes the week of April 6 - 12, 2025 as Delaware Saves Week.
