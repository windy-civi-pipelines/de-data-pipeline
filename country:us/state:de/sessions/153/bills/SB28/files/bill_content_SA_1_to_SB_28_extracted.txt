Section 1:
Legislation Document SPONSOR: Sen.Â Brown DELAWARE STATE SENATE 153rd GENERAL ASSEMBLY SENATE AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO SENATE BILL NO. 28 AMEND Senate Bill No. 28 on line 3 by deleting âÂ§ 6750.â before âFuneralâ and inserting in lieu thereof â Â§ 6750. Â§ 6701A. â therein. FURTHER AMEND Senate Bill No. 28 between lines 17 and 18 by inserting the following and redesignating bill Section numbers accordingly: âSection 2. Amend Chapter 67A, Title 18 of the Delaware Code by making deletions as shown by strike through and insertions as shown by underline as follows: Â§ 6702A. Source of payments under this chapter. Payments made under this chapter must be made from the fund established under subchapter III of Chapter 65 of this title. The General Assembly shall, when necessary, provide adequate funding to the fund to cover claims under this chapter. â. SYNOPSIS This Amendment clarifies that funeral expenses for deceased volunteer firefighters must be paid from the same self-insurance fund as line-of-duty disability benefits for firefighters under Â§ 6707 of Title 18. This clarification is consistent with current procedure but is necessary because the section providing funeral expenses for deceased volunteer firefighters is in Chapter 67A of Title 18, not Chapter 67. This Amendment also redesignates the section providing funeral expenses for deceased volunteer firefighters to conform to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual.
