Legislation Document SPONSOR: Sen.Â Paradee & Rep.Â Phillips Sens. Cruce, Hansen, Hoffner, Huxtable, Pinkney; Reps. Gorman, Lambert, Morrison, Romer, Snyder-Hall DELAWARE STATE SENATE 153rd GENERAL ASSEMBLY SENATE SUBSTITUTE NO. 1 FOR SENATE BILL NO. 130 AN ACT TO AMEND TITLE 7 OF THE DELAWARE CODE RELATING TO EXPANDED POLYSTYRENE FOAM PRODUCTS. WHEREAS, discarded and fugitive single-use expanded polystyrene foam products such as food and beverage containers and other products constitute a significant and growing portion of litter found in Delawareâs parks, beaches, streams, and streets; and WHEREAS, expanded polystyrene foam cannot be readily recycled in Delaware in the curbside program, and the small percentage that is recycled only has one more life cycle, and is not able to be recycled repeatedly; and WHEREAS, once used for food or liquids, expanded polystyrene foam may not be recycled; and WHEREAS, non-compostable and non-recyclable materials pose a challenge to any environmentally and financially responsible solid waste management program with a goal of circularity; and WHEREAS, regulation of food packaging is necessary to encourage a culture of reuse and circularity, and to reduce the volume of solid waste disposed of in Delawareâs landfills and the economic and environmental costs of waste management; and WHEREAS, expanded polystyrene foam food service products are either discarded in our landfills, become litter where they can harm humans and wildlife, including marine animals, or break down into microparticles that enter our ecosystem and food chain; and WHEREAS, expanded polystyrene foam contains the toxic substances styrene and benzene, which are suspected carcinogens and neurotoxins that are hazardous to humans; and WHEREAS, hot foods and liquids start to break down expanded polystyrene foam upon contact, causing some toxins to be absorbed into the bloodstream and tissue of anyone who consumes foods or liquids that have been in expanded polystyrene foam packaging; and WHEREAS, disadvantaged communities are often the most impacted by improper disposal of waste items such as those made of expanded polystyrene foam; and WHEREAS, 2.3 million tons of expanded polystyrene foam end up in landfills each year worldwide; and WHEREAS, expanded polystyrene foam has an expected lifetime of 500 years in landfills; and WHEREAS, at least 9 states and many local governments have banned all or most uses of expanded polystyrene foam food service packaging products, including California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Maine, Vermont, Colorado, Oregon, Washington State, Santa Cruz, Los Angeles, and Washington DC. NOW, THEREFORE: BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE: Section 1.

(a) For purposes of this subchapter, section, the following definitions shall apply: Section 3. This Act takes effect on January 1, 2027. SYNOPSIS This Act prohibits retail stores and wholesalers from selling, distributing, or offering for sale in this State expanded polystyrene foam food service packaging products, most expanded polystyrene foam coolers, and expanded polystyrene foam loose fill packaging, such as packing peanuts. These types of expanded polystyrene foam products are difficult to recycle and are not accepted in Delawareâs curbside recycling program. Such products typically end up in landfills, where they take hundreds of years to break down. By prohibiting the sale of expanded polystyrene food service packaging products, expanded polystyrene foam coolers, and expanded polystyrene foam loose fill packaging, this Act helps protect the environment from harmful waste. The Act does allow for certain uses of expanded polystyrene packaging (e.g., trays for raw or butchered meat) when necessary for health and safety reasons. This Act also allows for a temporary waiver of its prohibition on expanded polystyrene foam food packaging, expanded polystyrene foam coolers, and expanded polystyrene foam loose fill packaging if there is not a financially feasible or commercially available alternative for a specific expanded polystyrene foam product prohibited under this Act, and the retail store or wholesaler can show that the ban will cause a significant financial hardship. This Act is a Substitute for Senate Bill No. 130. It differs from Senate Bill No. 130 as follows: 1. Specifies that the prohibition on expanded polystyrene foam products is limited to expanded polystyrene foam food service packaging, expanded polystyrene foam coolers, and expanded polystyrene foam loose fill packaging such as packing peanuts. 2. Clarifies that the prohibition on these products applies only to products sold in Delaware, by Delaware retail stores and wholesalers, and narrows the definitions of retail stores and wholesalers accordingly. This change is being made to alleviate concerns that the Act attempted to regulate expanded polystyrene foam products sales in other states. 3. Explicitly excludes food establishments such as restaurants from the definition of âretail storeâ, as the use of polystyrene foam food service products in food establishments is already regulated under Â§ 3004Q of Title 16. 4. Removes language that had allowed the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control the discretion to create new exemptions. 5. Creates an exemption for expanded polystyrene coolers used to transport or ship live fish or other marine life. 6. Consolidates the waiver provisions into a single provision that allows for a 1-year renewable waiver in cases where compliance with is not a financially feasible and commercially available alternative for a specific expanded polystyrene foam product and the retailer or wholesaler can show that the ban will cause significant financial hardship. This Act takes effect on January 1, 2027. Author: Senator Paradee
