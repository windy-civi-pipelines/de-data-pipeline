WHEREAS, every year, thousands of workers are killed and millions more are injured or diseased due to hazardous working conditions; and WHEREAS, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) recently released its 34th annual Death on the Job: The Toll of Neglect report, revealing that an alarming 385 U.S. workers died every day in 2023 due to hazardous working conditions, amounting to 5,283 fatalities from traumatic injury and an estimated 135,304 deaths from occupational disease; and WHEREAS, the report further reveals stark inequities in workplace safety: Black workers are dying at higher rates than other workers, and Latino workers suffer the highest job fatality rateâ26% above the national average; and WHEREAS, serious threats persist across industries, including a 57% increase in serious workplace violence injuries among health care and social assistance workers over the past 15 years; and WHEREAS, exposure to extreme heat claimed the lives of at least 55 U.S. workers in recent yearsâa number known to be a significant undercount due to inadequate tracking and reporting; and WHEREAS, despite these dangers, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) remains severely underfunded and understaffed, with only one inspector for every 85,000 workers nationwide and an effective budget of just $3.92 per worker to ensure safe conditions; and WHEREAS, Workers Memorial Day is observed annually on April 28 to honor the memory of those who have lost their lives or suffered injury or illness on the job, and to recommit to the promise of safer working conditions for all; and WHEREAS, April 28 also marks the anniversary of the creation of OSHA in 1971, and serves as a reminder of the progress that has been made, and the urgent work that remains; and WHEREAS, the State of Delaware honors the labor and sacrifice of working men and women across all sectorsâfrom construction and public safety to education, manufacturing, and healthcareâand reaffirms its commitment to protecting their well-being. NOW, THEREFORE: BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the 153rd General Assembly of the State of Delaware, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that April 28, 2025, is hereby recognized as Workers Memorial Day in the State of Delaware. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the General Assembly calls upon all Delawareans to remember those who have died on the job, to support policies that protect the living, and to advance the cause of safe and just workplaces for all. SYNOPSIS This resolution recognizes April 28, 2025, as Workers Memorial Day in the State of Delaware and calls upon all Delawareans to remember those who have died on the job, to support policies that protect the living, and to advance the cause of safe and just workplaces for all.
