(2) A civil violation is not a bar to an individual seeking, or a court or the State Bureau of Identification granting, a discretionary or mandatory expungement, even if the civil violation is combined in the same case with other offenses that are eligible for expungement. (3) The definition of âcaseâ does not include a Title 21 offense, or an equivalent offense, or a civil violation that is or could be joined for prosecution with another charge or set of charges related to a complaint or incident. Therefore, a court or the State Bureau of Identification may not deny a request for a discretionary or mandatory expungement under this subchapter because the set of charges for which the discretionary or mandatory expungement is sought includes a conviction of a Title 21 offense, or an equivalent offense, or a finding of, or agreement to, responsibility for a civil violation. (4) Driving after judgment prohibited, reckless driving, and operation of a motor vehicle causing death are not eligible for discretionary expungement as they are not reported on certified criminal histories. (5) References to Title 21 offenses include an offense under any county or municipal code, ordinance, or regulation which is the same as, or equivalent to, any offense under Title 21 of the Delaware Code.
