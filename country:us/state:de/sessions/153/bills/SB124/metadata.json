      "abstract": "In Cornette v. State, 2024 Del. Super. Lexis 455 (June 11, 2024), the Superior Court denied a discretionary expungement because the applicant\u2019s case included a Title 21 conviction. The Court held: \u201cPursuant to 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4372, in order for the Court to grant expungement the entire case must be eligible for expungement. This means that all charges within one case must be expungable. The Court will not split convictions and expunge a conviction in one case where the other charges within the same case are not expungable.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis Act makes all of the following clear:\r\n(1) The General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting some of the recent changes to Delaware\u2019s expungement laws was to make clear that Title 21 offenses do not operate as a bar to an individual seeking, or a court or the State Bureau of Identification granting, a discretionary or mandatory expungement, even if the Title 21 offenses are combined in the same case with other offenses that are eligible for expungement. \r\n(2) A civil violation is not a bar to an individual seeking, or a court or the State Bureau of Identification granting, a discretionary or mandatory expungement, even if the civil violation is combined in the same case with other offenses that are eligible for expungement.\r\n(3) The definition of \u201ccase\u201d does not include a Title 21 offense, or an equivalent offense, or a civil violation that is or could be joined for prosecution with another charge or set of charges related to a complaint or incident. Therefore, a court or the State Bureau of Identification may not deny a request for a discretionary or mandatory expungement under this subchapter because the set of charges for which the discretionary or mandatory expungement is sought includes a conviction of a Title 21 offense, or an equivalent offense, or a finding of, or agreement to, responsibility for a civil violation.\r\n(4) Driving after judgment prohibited, reckless driving, and operation of a motor vehicle causing death are not eligible for discretionary expungement as they are not reported on certified criminal histories.\r\n(5) References to Title 21 offenses include an offense under any county or municipal code, ordinance, or regulation which is the same as, or equivalent to, any offense under Title 21 of the Delaware Code."
