Section 1:
Legislation Document SPONSOR: Rep.Â K.Â Williams HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 153rd GENERAL ASSEMBLY HOUSE AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO SENATE BILL NO. 48 AMEND Senate Bill No. 48, as amended, by deleting lines 2 through 3 of Senate Amendment No. 1 in their entirety. FURTHER AMEND Senate Bill No. 48, as amended, on lines 14 through 15 by deleting â driver, a student, or any passenger entering, leaving, or waiting for the school bus. â as it appears therein and inserting in lieu thereof the following: â driver or a school bus passenger, including when the school bus driver or the school bus passenger is entering, leaving, or waiting for the school bus. â. FURTHER AMEND Senate Bill No. 48, as amended, by deleting lines 17 through 18 in their entirety and inserting in lieu thereof the following: â (c) A passenger, including a student, authorized to be on the school bus in the ordinary course of business may not be guilty of disorderly conduct for a violation of paragraph (a)(3) of this section. â. SYNOPSIS This Amendment to Senate Bill No. 48, as amended by Senate Amendment No. 1, makes the following changes: (1) Clarifies that intentional interference with the operation of a school bus can occur if threats are against the bus driver or any passenger on the bus, regardless of the passenger's status, such as a student, bus attendant, disability aide, school staff, or a contractor. This clarification is made by removing specific examples of passengers that might be covered because a detailed list of possible passengers has the unintended effect of narrowing the application of the provision. (2) Clarifies that the intentional interference with the operation of a school bus can also occur if the threats are made while the school bus passenger is on the bus, not only when entering, leaving, or waiting for the school bus. (3) Clarifies that only those passengers, including students, who are authorized to be on the school bus in the ordinary course of business may not be guilty of disorderly conduct for intentionally interfering with the operation of a school bus.
