SYNOPSIS This Act repeals the cap on the amount of money in the Delaware Manufactured Home Relocation Trust Fund (Trust Fund), resolving contradictory provisions in current law regarding the Delaware Manufactured Home Relocation Authority (DEMHRA) Boardâs authority to adjust the amount in the Trust Fund. Under Â§ 7042(e) of Title 25, the DEMHRA Board can adjust, eliminate, or reinstate the cap on the Trust Fund with the approval of at least 3 of the 5 members of the DEMHRA Board. However, Â§ 7042(e) also provides a dollar amount cap on the amount in the Trust Fund, which under the Delaware Constitution, DEMHRA cannot change. DEMHRA needs to be able to adjust the cap on the Trust Fund because under Â§ 7041(b)(1) and Â§ 7042(b) of Title 25, the money in the Trust Fund is the only money available to DEMHRA to pay administrative costs and to carry out DEMHRAâs responsibilities under Chapters 70 and 71 of Title 25. Recent legislation has given DEMHRA additional responsibilities under subchapter VI of Chapter 70 when a community owner seeks to increase the rent, but DEMHRA does not receive any appropriations to support this work. Instead, except for money appropriated for board meeting stipends, DEMHRA is âresponsible for all direct and indirect costs for its operations under Â§ 7042 of this title, including receipts and disbursements, personnel, rental of facilities, and reimbursement to other state agencies for services provided and, therefore, must be fiscally revenue-neutral.â This Act also makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual by revising Â§ 7041(c)(3) of Title 25 so that the number of Board members who must vote in favor of adjusting the Trust Fund is clearly stated with the Boardâs other responsibilities.
