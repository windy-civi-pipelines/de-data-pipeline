An elected official elected on or after January 1, 2012, shall be eligible to receive a pension beginning with the first month after the attainment of age 60, provided that the elected official shall have served at least 20 years at the time of the elected officialâs termination of service as an elected official, or beginning with the first month after attainment of age 65, provided that the elected official shall have served at least 10 years at the time of the elected officialâs termination of service as an elected official. For the purposes of this section, a member of the General Assembly who is elected on Election Day in November and serves through the next Election Day in November will receive full-service credit for that term. Any pension for credited service other than as an elected official shall be determined under the remainder of this chapter as a separate pension.
