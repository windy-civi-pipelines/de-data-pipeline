The amendments to Â§ 18-106(e) in this Section are intended to provide rules different from the rules applied in existing case law that Â§ 18-106(e) is limited to ratification or waiver of a limited liability companyâs own acts and transactions and that Â§ 18-106(e) does not apply to ratification or waiver by conduct.  </span>
