3 court space needs statewide, including addressing operational deficiencies of the Family Court facilities in Sussex and
4 Kent Counties, and other downstate court facilities, as identified in the Southern Court Facilities Space Study
5 (October 31, 2006), a court facilities improvement working group shall be established, consisting of representatives

8 and potentially innovative solutions to these and other court facility space issues. The working group shall engage
9 with the Delaware State Bar Association to obtain input from practitioners who practice in the affected courts
10 regarding the best manner to ensure that litigants have access to high-quality, dignified, and safe courthouses within
11 reasonable proximity to their residences, and what combination of courthouses will accomplish that goal in the
12 manner most cost-effective to taxpayers in the long term. For the same reason, the working group will obtain input
13 from other state agencies that provide services related to litigants in the affected courts, to consider whether the co-
14 location of offices would be helpful to those receiving services and be more efficient for state taxpayers in the long
15 term.

12 Section 26. Design-Build Contracts. The Office of Management and Budget is hereby authorized to
13 utilize or approve the design-build contract mechanism for up to twelve construction projects that are deemed
14 necessary by the Director for the efficient construction and improvement of state facilities. Design-build is a project

16 single contract for both architectural/engineering services and construction. The selection processes and other terms
17 of such contracts may vary considerably from project to project. The design-build entity may be a single firm, a
18 consortium, joint venture, or other organization. However, the fundamental element of design-build delivery remains
19 that one entity assumes primary responsibility for design and construction of the project. The Office of Management
20 and Budget is authorized to use this approach in completing its projects, subject to the following conditions:

29 concerning design-build contracting.

9 cooperative program in which students from Vocational Technical schools will work on the project for a set number
10 of hours at a paid wage rate appropriate for the individual student’s skill level and scope of work. The wage rate will
11 be established by OMB and the Vocational Technical School District where the project is located and will not be
12 below the minimum wage rate. This wage rate shall be recognized by the Department of Labor as “OMB Pilot
13 Program Coop Student Rate” in lieu of a Prevailing Wage rate on the pilot project. This Student Rate is applicable to
14 this pilot project only.
15 For projects that are part of the DBE pilot program, the contract award will be based on a form of best value,
16 for which, 29 Del. C. § 6962 (d)(13)a.4. is waived. The agency will establish a best value process, which may include

1 DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE
2 Section 74. Bond Proceeds Reimbursement. Unless not permitted by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
3 as amended (the Code), whenever the General Assembly authorizes the issuance of the State’s General Obligation
4 bonds or the Delaware Transportation Authority’s (the Authority) revenue bonds to finance the costs of specific
5 capital projects, it is the intent of the General Assembly that the interest on such bonds shall not be included in gross
6 income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Code, and the United States Treasury Regulations
7 (the Regulations) thereunder as they may be promulgated from time to time, or shall be qualified as Build America
8 Bonds pursuant to the Code and the Regulations. Pursuant to the State's budget and financial policies, other than
9 unexpected situations where surplus revenues render bond financing unnecessary or undesirable, no funds other than
10 the proceeds of such bonds, are or are reasonably expected to be, reserved, allocated on a long-term basis or
11 otherwise set aside by the State to pay the costs of such specific capital projects. Pursuant to the Authority’s budget
12 and financial policies, it is expected that approximately 50 percent of the costs of its capital projects shall be funded
13 on a long-term basis from the proceeds of such bonds. However, after the authorization of such bonds, but prior to
14 their issuance, non-bond funds from the State’s General Fund or the Authority’s Transportation Trust Fund or other
15 funds may be advanced on a temporary basis to pay a portion of the costs of such specific capital projects. In that
16 event, it is expected that these non-bond funds will be reimbursed from the proceeds of such bonds when they are
17 issued. This reimbursement may cause a portion of such bonds to become reimbursement bonds within the meaning
18 of Section 1.150-2 of the Regulations. Under those Regulations, to preserve the exclusion of the interest on such
19 bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes, it may be necessary to make a declaration of official intent.
20 The Secretary of Finance is hereby designated as the appropriate representative of the State and the Secretary of
21 Transportation is hereby designated as the appropriate representative of the Authority, and each is authorized to
22 declare official intent on behalf of the State or the Authority, as the case may be, within the meaning of Section
23 1.150-2 of the Regulations, whenever and to the extent that such declaration is required to preserve such tax
24 treatment.
