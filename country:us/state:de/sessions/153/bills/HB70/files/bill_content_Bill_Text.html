To that end, this Substitute bill defines large property owners as persons that own or control 20 or more rental units, while small property owners are defined as persons who control fewer than 20 rental units. In addition to different deadlines, small property owners may certify a multi-unit property by inspecting only 5 units of the property. All owners may request a certificate deferral if lead inspectors or certified contractors are not available or if remediation or abatement would create a significant economic burden on the property owner.  Unlike HB 70, small and large property owners must obtain lead free or lead safe certification before a rental unit is turned over to a new tenant, but no later than 4 years after the Act is implemented.  </span>

Units must be recertified as lead free or lead safe if a lead-based paint hazard is discovered in the rental unit or if individuals residing in the unit develop elevated lead blood levels.</span>

A landlord may not raise the rent on a rental unit that benefits from a grant or loan under this program for 3 years. It also permits the lead-based paint hazard control grant and loan program to issue loans to large property owners for 10% of the costs associated with lead abatement or remediation if the landlord can show the expenditure would be a significant financial burden.  </span>
