The alternative housing must be provided before or during the abatement or remediation of the rental unit. The landlord must provide the tenant with at least 10 days advance notice before the tenant is required to move into or out of the alternative housing.

Additional documentation relating to lead-based paint hazards. (a) When filing a complaint for possession, the landlord must provide documentation to the court demonstrating that the property is in compliance with Chapter 54 of this title, relating to lead-based paint hazards. (b) If the reason for the complaint is because the tenant will not provide reasonable access to the property so that the landlord may comply with Chapter 54 of this title, then documentation under subsection (a) of this section is not required. Section 4. Amend Â§ 2612, Title 16 of the Delaware Code by making deletions as shown by strike through and insertions as shown by underline as follows: Â§ 2612. Remediation and abatement duties of Delaware State Lead-Based Paint Program. (d) Competitive bid invitations issued by the Program for lead-based paint abatement or remediation must contain all of the following: (1) Provisions requiring verification by bidders of procedures to be used for risk assessment. (2) Provisions requiring verification by bidders of procedures to be specified by the Program to limit the generation of lead dust, contain lead dust within work areas, conduct daily and final cleanings, and perform clearance testing.

Section 5. This Act is effective immediately and is to be implemented as follows: (1) Â§ 5410 of Title 25, as contained in Section 1 of this Act, must be implemented immediately and an initial report must be issued by March 1, 2026. (2) The remainder of the Act must be implemented starting on March 1, 2027. SYNOPSIS In addition to other changes, this Substitute requires that a feasibility study be completed by March 1, 2026, a year before the remainder of this Act will be enforced. It also adds 5 additional members to the Committee issuing the feasibility review and appoints the Director of DSHA, or the Directorâs designee, as the chair of this Committee. It also directs the Committee to answer a number of specific questions about the feasibility of this Act. Similar to HS 1 to HB 70, HS 2 to HB 70 differentiates between large property owners and small property owners, recognizing that smaller property owners may find lead certification to be prohibitively expensive and may need more time and assistance to comply with this Act. To that end, this Substitute bill defines large property owners as persons that own or control 20 or more rental units, while small property owners are defined as persons who control fewer than 20 rental units. In addition to different deadlines, small property owners may certify a multi-unit property by inspecting only 5 units of the property. All owners may request a certificate deferral if lead inspectors or certified contractors are not available or if remediation or abatement would create a significant economic burden on the property owner. Unlike HB 70, small and large property owners must obtain lead free or lead safe certification before a rental unit is turned over to a new tenant, but no later than 4 years after the Act is implemented. As in HB 70, if the rental unit is uninhabitable, the landlord must provide alternative housing while the unit undergoes lead abatement or remediation. Recertification for lead safe units must occur prior to commencement of any rental agreement more than 4 years after the date the unit was last certified. Units must be recertified as lead free or lead safe if a lead-based paint hazard is discovered in the rental unit or if individuals residing in the unit develop elevated lead blood levels. Similar to HB 70, this Act creates a Lead-based Paint Hazard Control Grant and Loan Program. Preference for grants must be given to families with young children, pregnant individuals, or tenants regularly visited by children under 6 years old. For landlords with 5 or few units, grants or loans may be issued for 100% of the costs incurred to obtain certification. For landlords with 6-19 units, 50% of the costs may be covered by the fund. A landlord may not raise the rent on a rental unit that benefits from a grant or loan under this program for 3 years. It also permits the lead-based paint hazard control grant and loan program to issue loans to large property owners for 10% of the costs associated with lead abatement or remediation if the landlord can show the expenditure would be a significant financial burden. This Substitute bill further requires DHSS to provide an annual report to the Governor and the General Assembly regarding the number and types of certifications issued under this Act, as well as any violations or civil penalties issued. Prior to filing a complaint for eviction, this Substitute bill requires the landlord to provide documentation that the property in question is in compliance with this Act. No documentation is required if a complaint is filed because the tenant refuses to provide reasonable access to the rental unit so that the landlord may comply with this chapter. As in HB 70, this Act also does the following: (1) Establishes a Lead-Based Paint Remediation Certification Committee to study the available workforce and available public funding to support the inspection and remediation efforts required by this Act along with the feasibility of meeting deadlines established under this Act. (2) Prohibits landlords from discriminating against individuals because they make a complaint or assist in an investigation or proceeding relating to a lead-based paint hazard in a rental unit or premises. (3) Prohibits landlords from discriminating against individuals residing in a unit who have elevated blood lead levels or children or pregnant individuals who may be affected by lead-based paint hazards. (4) Requires that contractors performing lead-based paint abatement or remediation under the Delaware State Lead-Based Paint Program provide for the safety of workers performing lead-based paint remediation work, including free blood testing for workers at least every 3 months. Aside from the feasibility review, this Act will not be implemented or enforced until March 1, 2027.

(12) âRegularly visitedâ means visited at least 2 times a week for 3 or more hours at least 10 weeks per year. (13) âRental unitâ means as defined in Â§ 5141 of Title 25. (14) âRental unit constructed beforeâ a given date means a rental unit for which a construction permit was obtained before that date. If no permit was obtained, it means that construction of the rental unit was started before that date. (15) âSignificant economic burdenâ means the required expenditure would materially affect the landlordâs ability to maintain or operate the rental property. The Department must take the following factors into consideration when determining if an expenditure is a significant economic burden to the landlord: a. The total costs associated with lead abatement and remediation, including alternative housing. b. The overall financial resources of the landlord, including rental income, reserves, other sources of income, and financial obligations. c. The risk to tenant health and safety if the expenditure is delayed. (16) âSmall property ownerâ means a person who own or controls 19 or fewer rental units. Â§ 5402. Certification of Rental Units as Lead Free or Lead Safe â Small Property Owners. (a) Starting after the [implementation date of this section of this Act], a small property owner must obtain certification from a lead inspector that each of the ownerâs rental units constructed before January 1, 1978, is âlead freeâ or âlead safe.â The certificate must be obtained and filed with the Department prior to the commencement of a rental agreement with a new tenant, but no more than 4 years after [the implementation date of this section of this Act]. (b) The certificate required by subsection (a) of this section must include all of the following information: (1) The name and address of the landlord and any property manager. (2) The address of the rental unit. (3) The name of the lead inspector issuing the certificate. (4) The date the certificate was issued. (5) The date of the inspection of the rental unit and premises. (6) Whether the rental unit and premises are certified as lead free or lead safe. (c)(1) The failure to obtain and file a certificate prior to the required date is a violation of this section. The Department may assess a civil penalty up to $100 per day per rental unit until the required certificate is obtained and filed with the Department. No civil penalty may be imposed if a certificate deferment is issued by the Department prior to the date on which certification is required. (2) A certificate deferment may only be issued upon a showing that any of the following circumstances exist: a. No lead inspectors approved by the Department are available to provide an inspection of the rental unit prior to the certification deadline and the landlord requested a lead inspection at least 4 months prior to the certification deadline. The landlord must show evidence that the landlord contacted at least 3 lead inspectors to schedule an inspection at least 4 months before the certification deadline. b. The landlord shows in good faith that it is a significant economic burden for the landlord to comply with the statutory deadlines required under subsection (a) of this section. Good faith includes evidence that the landlord has applied to the lead-based paint hazard control grant and loan program for assistance under Â§ 5408 of this chapter. If there are no funds in the lead-based paint hazard control grant and loan program and compliance with this chapter is a significant economic burden, the landlord must receive a deferment. c. No contractors certified to perform lead-abatement or remediation work are available to complete any required lead abatement or remediation work prior to the certification deadline and the landlord requested the work at least 4 months prior to the certification deadline. The landlord must provide evidence to the Department that the landlord contacted at least 3 certified contractors at least 4 months before the certification deadline. d. The property is a multi-unit property and qualifies for deferment under subsection (g) of this section. (3) The length of the certificate deferment may not exceed 6 months, except as permitted under subsection (g) of this section. The Department may issue an additional deferment if the applicant shows that the circumstances under paragraph (c)(2) of this section continue to exist and the landlord is acting in good faith. (d) No certificate deferment may be issued if a lead hazard exists that makes the rental unit uninhabitable unless the landlord provides the tenant alternative housing as required by this chapter. (e) A tenant must permit reasonable access to the rental unit and premises for an inspection and evaluation by a lead inspector as required by this chapter and in accordance with Â§ 5509 of this title. (f) The landlord must provide for alternative housing when an inspection and evaluation by a lead inspector reveals that the rental unit is uninhabitable as a result of a lead-based paint hazard. The alternative housing must be provided before or during the abatement or remediation of the rental unit. The landlord must provide the tenant with at least 10 days advance notice before the tenant is required to move into or out of the alternative housing. Nothing in this chapter precludes a tenant and landlord from agreeing to terminate a rental agreement so long as such agreement is voluntary and not coerced. (g) Where the property requiring certification is a multi-unit building under the control of a small property owner, the lead inspector may choose 5 units in the building to inspect in lieu of an inspection of all units in the multi-unit building. If the 5 units are selected by the lead inspector at random and are found to be lead safe by the lead inspector, only those rental units inspected by the lead inspector may be certified as lead safe and the rest of the units may receive a certificate deferral under this section for no more than 4 years. If any of the 5 units selected by the lead inspector at random are found to contain a lead-based paint hazard, then all the units in the multi-unit building must be inspected and receive certification under this chapter. The landlord must provide any tenant in a rental unit receiving a certificate deferral under this subsection notice that the tenantâs rental unit has not been inspected pursuant to this section.

(b) The certificate required by subsection (a) of this section must include all of the following information: (1) The name and address of the landlord and any property manager. (2) The address of the rental unit. (3) The name of the lead inspector issuing the certificate. (4) The date the certificate was issued. (5) The date of the inspection of the rental unit and premises. (6) Whether the rental unit and premises are certified as lead free or lead safe. (c) The failure to obtain and file a certificate prior to the required date is a violation of this section. The Department may assess a civil penalty as follows: (1) For the first 30 days of noncompliance, a civil penalty of up to $500 per day per rental unit until the certificate is filed. (2) After the first 30 days, a civil penalty of up to $750 per day per rental unit until the certificate is filed. (3) After 60 days of noncompliance, a civil penalty of up to $1000 per day per rental unit until the certificate is filed. (d) (1) No civil penalty may be imposed if a certificate deferment is issued by the Department prior to the date on which certification is required.

(a) When filing a complaint for possession, the landlord must provide documentation to the court demonstrating that the property is in compliance with Chapter 54 of this title, relating to lead-based paint hazards. (b) If the reason for the complaint is because the tenant will not provide reasonable access to the property so that the landlord may comply with Chapter 54 of this title, then documentation under subsection (a) of this section is not required. Section 4. Amend Â§ 2612, Title 16 of the Delaware Code by making deletions as shown by strike through and insertions as shown by underline as follows: Â§ 2612. Remediation and abatement duties of Delaware State Lead-Based Paint Program. (d) Competitive bid invitations issued by the Program for lead-based paint abatement or remediation must contain all of the following: (1) Provisions requiring verification by bidders of procedures to be used for risk assessment.

Section 5. This Act is effective immediately and is to be implemented as follows: (1) Â§ 5410 of Title 25, as contained in Section 1 of this Act, must be implemented immediately and an initial report must be issued by March 1, 2026. (2) The remainder of the Act must be implemented starting on March 1, 2027. SYNOPSIS In addition to other changes, this Substitute requires that a feasibility study be completed by March 1, 2026, a year before the remainder of this Act will be enforced. It also adds 5 additional members to the Committee issuing the feasibility review and appoints the Director of DSHA, or the Directorâs designee, as the chair of this Committee. It also directs the Committee to answer a number of specific questions about the feasibility of this Act. Similar to HS 1 to HB 70, HS 2 to HB 70 differentiates between large property owners and small property owners, recognizing that smaller property owners may find lead certification to be prohibitively expensive and may need more time and assistance to comply with this Act. To that end, this Substitute bill defines large property owners as persons that own or control 20 or more rental units, while small property owners are defined as persons who control fewer than 20 rental units. In addition to different deadlines, small property owners may certify a multi-unit property by inspecting only 5 units of the property. All owners may request a certificate deferral if lead inspectors or certified contractors are not available or if remediation or abatement would create a significant economic burden on the property owner. Unlike HB 70, small and large property owners must obtain lead free or lead safe certification before a rental unit is turned over to a new tenant, but no later than 4 years after the Act is implemented. As in HB 70, if the rental unit is uninhabitable, the landlord must provide alternative housing while the unit undergoes lead abatement or remediation. Recertification for lead safe units must occur prior to commencement of any rental agreement more than 4 years after the date the unit was last certified. Units must be recertified as lead free or lead safe if a lead-based paint hazard is discovered in the rental unit or if individuals residing in the unit develop elevated lead blood levels. Similar to HB 70, this Act creates a Lead-based Paint Hazard Control Grant and Loan Program. Preference for grants must be given to families with young children, pregnant individuals, or tenants regularly visited by children under 6 years old. For landlords with 5 or few units, grants or loans may be issued for 100% of the costs incurred to obtain certification. For landlords with 6-19 units, 50% of the costs may be covered by the fund. A landlord may not raise the rent on a rental unit that benefits from a grant or loan under this program for 3 years. It also permits the lead-based paint hazard control grant and loan program to issue loans to large property owners for 10% of the costs associated with lead abatement or remediation if the landlord can show the expenditure would be a significant financial burden. This Substitute bill further requires DHSS to provide an annual report to the Governor and the General Assembly regarding the number and types of certifications issued under this Act, as well as any violations or civil penalties issued. Prior to filing a complaint for eviction, this Substitute bill requires the landlord to provide documentation that the property in question is in compliance with this Act. No documentation is required if a complaint is filed because the tenant refuses to provide reasonable access to the rental unit so that the landlord may comply with this chapter. As in HB 70, this Act also does the following: (1) Establishes a Lead-Based Paint Remediation Certification Committee to study the available workforce and available public funding to support the inspection and remediation efforts required by this Act along with the feasibility of meeting deadlines established under this Act. (2) Prohibits landlords from discriminating against individuals because they make a complaint or assist in an investigation or proceeding relating to a lead-based paint hazard in a rental unit or premises. (3) Prohibits landlords from discriminating against individuals residing in a unit who have elevated blood lead levels or children or pregnant individuals who may be affected by lead-based paint hazards. (4) Requires that contractors performing lead-based paint abatement or remediation under the Delaware State Lead-Based Paint Program provide for the safety of workers performing lead-based paint remediation work, including free blood testing for workers at least every 3 months. Aside from the feasibility review, this Act will not be implemented or enforced until March 1, 2027.
