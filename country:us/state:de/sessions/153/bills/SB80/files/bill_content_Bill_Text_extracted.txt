(b) In an action involving public petition and participation, damages may only be recovered if the plaintiff, in addition to all other necessary elements, shall have established by clear and convincing evidence that any communication which gives rise to the action was made with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard of whether it was false, where the truth or falsity of such communication is material to the cause of action at issue. (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit any constitutional, statutory or common-law protection of defendants to actions involving public petition and participation. [Repealed, but see Chapter 60 of this title.] Section 3. Amend Â§ 8137, Title 10 of the Delaware Code by making deletions as shown by strike through and insertions as shown by underline as follows: Â§ 8137. Standards for motion to dismiss and summary judgment in certain cases involving public petition and participation. (a) A motion to dismiss in which the moving party has demonstrated that the action, claim, cross-claim or counterclaim subject to the motion is an action involving public petition and participation as defined in Â§â8136 of this title shall be granted unless the party responding to the motion demonstrates that the cause of action has a substantial basis in law or is supported by a substantial argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law. The court shall grant preference in the hearing of such motion. (b) A motion for summary judgment in which the moving party has demonstrated that the action, claim, cross-claim or counterclaim subject to the action is an action involving public petition and participation as defined in Â§â8136 of this title shall be granted unless the party responding to the motion demonstrates that the cause of action has a substantial basis in fact and law or is supported by a substantial argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law. The court shall grant preference in the hearing of such motion. [Repealed, but see Chapter 60 of this title.] Section 4. Amend Â§ 8138, Title 10 of the Delaware Code by making deletions as shown by strike through and insertions as shown by underline as follows: Â§ 8138. Recovery of damages in actions involving public petition and participation. (a) A defendant in an action involving public petition and participation, as defined in Â§â8136 of this title, may maintain an action, claim, cross-claim or counter-claim to recover damages, including costs and attorneyâs fees, from any person who commenced or continued such action; provided that: (1) Costs, attorneyâs fees and other compensatory damages may be recovered upon a demonstration that the action involving public petition and participation was commenced or continued without a substantial basis in fact and law and could not be supported by a substantial argument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing law; and (2) Punitive damages may only be recovered upon an additional demonstration that the action involving public petition and participation was commenced or continued for the purpose of harassing, intimidating, punishing or otherwise maliciously inhibiting the free exercise of speech, petition or association rights.

(c) Nothing in this section shall affect or preclude the right of any party to any recovery otherwise authorized by law. [Repealed, but see Chapter 60 of this title.] Section 5. Sections 8136 through 8138 of Title 10 of the Delaware Code continue to apply to a cause of action asserted in a civil action before the effective date of this Act. SYNOPSIS This Act adopts the Uniform Public Expression Protection Act ("the Act") authored by the Uniform Law Commission. The Uniform Law Commission âprovides states with non-partisan, well-conceived and well-drafted legislation that brings clarity and stability to critical areas of state statutory law.â The Act was adopted by the Uniform Law Commission in October 2020 and has been adopted in 10 states, including New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and is currently pending in 10 states. The Act protects the publicâs right to engage in activities protected by the First Amendment without abusive, expensive legal retaliation. Specifically, the Act combats the problem of strategic lawsuits against public participation, also called âSLAPPs.â A SLAPP may come in the form of a defamation, invasion of privacy, nuisance, or other claim, but its real goal is to entangle the defendant of a SLAPP in expensive litigation and stifle the ability to engage in constitutionally protected activities. While Delaware has an âanti-SLAPPâ law (see Â§Â§ 8136 through 8138 of Title 10 of the Delaware Code), the law received a score of âD-â from the Institute for Free Speech due to limited types of speech it protects and lack of basic protections provided by the Act.
