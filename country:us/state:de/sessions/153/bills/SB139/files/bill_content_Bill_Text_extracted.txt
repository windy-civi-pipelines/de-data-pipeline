[Transferred.] SYNOPSIS This Act provides protections and rights to victims of sexual assault by doing all of the following: â¢	Codifying the core sections of Delaware's Sexual Assault Kit (SAK) testing policy, adopted in May 2022. â¢	Enacts the recommendations of the Victims' Bill of Rights Committee (VBR Committee), established under SCR 99, (152nd General Assembly) providing rights to victims regarding information about the location, status, and preservation of biological evidence. These protections and rights for victims of sexual assault are in addition to existing requirements for DNA analysis performed by the Division of Forensic Science (DFS) laboratory under Chapter 47 of Title 29 and the Victimsâ Bill of Rights under Chapter 94 of Title 11. Section 1 revises the definitions in Chapter 47 of Title 29 by transferring definitions from Â§ 4713 of Title 29, updating existing definitions, and creating new defined terms that reflect current practices. Section 2 updates existing requirements under Â§ 4713 of Title 29 that apply when the DFS laboratory receives, analyzes, and classifies biological samples and obtains DNA results, by doing all of the following: â¢	Adding the names of the state and federal DNA databases. â¢	Referencing current law-enforcement procedures, including the names of Delawareâs criminal justice case management systems. â¢	Requiring the Department of Justice, or a law-enforcement agency authorized by the Department of Justice, to inform DFS if the investigation has determined that no crime occurred in the case connected to a biological sample that has been submitted. This enables DFS to comply with NDIS policies and procedures related to when DNA results can be included in the National DNA Index System. â¢	Adding the VBR Committeeâs recommendations preventing the destruction of biological samples from unsolved sexual assault cases based on the victimâs age at the time of the alleged offense. For adults, these biological samples may not be destroyed until 20 years after the collection of the evidence and if the victim was under 18 years of age, until the victim is 40 years old. â¢	Adding references to the new SAK-specific provisions under Â§ 4713A of Title 29 and Â§ 9403B of Title 11. Section 3 adds additional requirements that apply when the DFS laboratory conducts DNA analysis of SAKs, codifying Section 5 and Section 7 of the existing SAK testing policy. Section 4 adds definitions related to biological evidence to Chapter 94 of Title 11 for the Victimsâ Bill of Rights. Section 5 adds the following to the Victimsâ Bill of Rights: â¢	Requirements that apply to investigating law-enforcement agencies, codifying provisions in Section 3 and Section 4 of the existing SAK testing policy. â¢	The VBR Committeeâs recommendations regarding victimsâ rights to information about the location, status, and preservation of biological evidence, such as learning the status and results of DNA testing. Victims of unsolved sexual assault cases have the right to notice before biological evidence is destroyed, to request that this evidence be preserved, and to designate another person to receive information about the status of biological evidence on their behalf. Section 6 updates how victims receive notifications from law-enforcement agencies that are required under the Victimsâ Bill of Rights, to allow for implementation of the victimsâ rights to information about biological evidence. All of the following changes were recommended by the VBR Committee and are identical to the language in Senate Bill No. 17 (153rd): â¢	Allowing law-enforcement agencies to send notifications electronically. â¢	Providing that victims are responsible for providing a law-enforcement agency with changes to the victimâs contact information. â¢	Allowing a victim to indicate and change their preferred method of contact by law-enforcement agencies, including a preference not to be contacted, and law-enforcement agencies must use the victimâs preferred method of contact when possible. Sections 7 through 9 revise the definitions of âDNAâ and âDNA profileâ in Part II of Title 11 for criminal procedure so they align with the definitions in Chapter 47 of Title 29. This Act also makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual. Author: Senator Pinkney

[Transferred.] SYNOPSIS This Act provides protections and rights to victims of sexual assault by doing all of the following: â¢	Codifying the core sections of Delaware's Sexual Assault Kit (SAK) testing policy, adopted in May 2022. â¢	Enacts the recommendations of the Victims' Bill of Rights Committee (VBR Committee), established under SCR 99, (152nd General Assembly) providing rights to victims regarding information about the location, status, and preservation of biological evidence. These protections and rights for victims of sexual assault are in addition to existing requirements for DNA analysis performed by the Division of Forensic Science (DFS) laboratory under Chapter 47 of Title 29 and the Victimsâ Bill of Rights under Chapter 94 of Title 11. Section 1 revises the definitions in Chapter 47 of Title 29 by transferring definitions from Â§ 4713 of Title 29, updating existing definitions, and creating new defined terms that reflect current practices. Section 2 updates existing requirements under Â§ 4713 of Title 29 that apply when the DFS laboratory receives, analyzes, and classifies biological samples and obtains DNA results, by doing all of the following: â¢	Adding the names of the state and federal DNA databases. â¢	Referencing current law-enforcement procedures, including the names of Delawareâs criminal justice case management systems. â¢	Requiring the Department of Justice, or a law-enforcement agency authorized by the Department of Justice, to inform DFS if the investigation has determined that no crime occurred in the case connected to a biological sample that has been submitted. This enables DFS to comply with NDIS policies and procedures related to when DNA results can be included in the National DNA Index System. â¢	Adding the VBR Committeeâs recommendations preventing the destruction of biological samples from unsolved sexual assault cases based on the victimâs age at the time of the alleged offense. For adults, these biological samples may not be destroyed until 20 years after the collection of the evidence and if the victim was under 18 years of age, until the victim is 40 years old. â¢	Adding references to the new SAK-specific provisions under Â§ 4713A of Title 29 and Â§ 9403B of Title 11. Section 3 adds additional requirements that apply when the DFS laboratory conducts DNA analysis of SAKs, codifying Section 5 and Section 7 of the existing SAK testing policy. Section 4 adds definitions related to biological evidence to Chapter 94 of Title 11 for the Victimsâ Bill of Rights. Section 5 adds the following to the Victimsâ Bill of Rights: â¢	Requirements that apply to investigating law-enforcement agencies, codifying provisions in Section 3 and Section 4 of the existing SAK testing policy. â¢	The VBR Committeeâs recommendations regarding victimsâ rights to information about the location, status, and preservation of biological evidence, such as learning the status and results of DNA testing. Victims of unsolved sexual assault cases have the right to notice before biological evidence is destroyed, to request that this evidence be preserved, and to designate another person to receive information about the status of biological evidence on their behalf. Section 6 updates how victims receive notifications from law-enforcement agencies that are required under the Victimsâ Bill of Rights, to allow for implementation of the victimsâ rights to information about biological evidence. All of the following changes were recommended by the VBR Committee and are identical to the language in Senate Bill No. 17 (153rd): â¢	Allowing law-enforcement agencies to send notifications electronically. â¢	Providing that victims are responsible for providing a law-enforcement agency with changes to the victimâs contact information. â¢	Allowing a victim to indicate and change their preferred method of contact by law-enforcement agencies, including a preference not to be contacted, and law-enforcement agencies must use the victimâs preferred method of contact when possible. Sections 7 through 9 revise the definitions of âDNAâ and âDNA profileâ in Part II of Title 11 for criminal procedure so they align with the definitions in Chapter 47 of Title 29. This Act also makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual. Author: Senator Pinkney
