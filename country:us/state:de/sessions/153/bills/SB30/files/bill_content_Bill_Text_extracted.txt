1 JUDICIAL
2 Section 19. Court Facilities Improvement Working Group. Recognizing that there are critical unmet
3 court space needs statewide, including addressing operational deficiencies of the Family Court facilities in Sussex and
4 Kent Counties, and other downstate court facilities, as identified in the Southern Court Facilities Space Study
5 (October 31, 2006), a court facilities improvement working group shall be established, consisting of representatives
6 from the Judicial Branch, the Office of the Governor, the Office of Management and Budget, including Facilities
7 Management, and the Office of the Controller General, to develop a plan for implementing flexible, cost-effective
8 and potentially innovative solutions to these and other court facility space issues. The working group shall engage
9 with the Delaware State Bar Association to obtain input from practitioners who practice in the affected courts
10 regarding the best manner to ensure that litigants have access to high-quality, dignified, and safe courthouses within
11 reasonable proximity to their residences, and what combination of courthouses will accomplish that goal in the
12 manner most cost-effective to taxpayers in the long term. For the same reason, the working group will obtain input
13 from other state agencies that provide services related to litigants in the affected courts, to consider whether the co-
14 location of offices would be helpful to those receiving services and be more efficient for state taxpayers in the long
15 term.
16 Section 20. Kent and Sussex County Judicial Court Facilities. (a) The Section 1 Addendum of this Act
17 includes an appropriation of $25,000,000 for Kent and Sussex Family Court Facilities. The Section 1 Addendum of 80

19 and 84 Del. Laws, c. 83 appropriated funding and Section 21 of 81 Del. Laws c. 59 provided spending authority to be
20 used toward preliminary costs, including planning and design, architectural and engineering work, construction costs
21 and costs associated with relocating the Department of Justice offices. Efficiencies shall be achieved in this process
22 through the combining of planning, design, architectural and engineering work for both facilities, in all circumstances
23 where combined efforts are appropriate and will likely achieve cost savings to the overall project.
24 (b)(a) Of this the amount, $3,610,000 appropriated in Section 1 Addendum of 83 Del. Laws c. 340, a portion
25 shall be used for the acquisition of tax parcel ID # 135-19.08-154.00, 135-19.08-146.01, and 135-15.17-148.00 for
26 final space and utility relocations.

28 from these appropriations may be used for the renovations of the Customs House and/or the Old Kent/Sussex Family
29 Courthouses.

1 OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET
2 Section 21. Construction Management. Notwithstanding any other state law, the Office of Management
3 and Budget shall be responsible for the design and construction of all the projects listed under Office of Management
4 and Budget in the Section 1 Addendum of this Act. For those projects that are solely for the purchase of equipment,
5 including projects that are funded in any Minor Capital Improvement (MCI) and Equipment line, the Office of
6 Management and Budget shall transfer the appropriate funding necessary to purchase the equipment to the agency for
7 which the equipment is being purchased. The appropriate amount of funding shall be determined and agreed to by
8 the Office of Management and Budget and the agency for which the equipment is being purchased by September 1 of
9 each fiscal year. For those projects for which the appropriation is passed to an entity and for which the State is not a
10 party to the construction contract, the Office of Management and Budget shall provide technical assistance.
11 (a) Notwithstanding any other state law, there is hereby created an Appeals Board, to be composed of the
12 Lieutenant Governor, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the Controller General. The
13 Appeals Board shall approve the use of all unencumbered monies after that project is deemed substantially complete.
14 A project shall be deemed substantially complete when the project is occupied by 75 percent of the planned tenants or

3 as amended (the Code), whenever the General Assembly authorizes the issuance of the State’s General Obligation
4 bonds or the Delaware Transportation Authority’s (the Authority) revenue bonds to finance the costs of specific
5 capital projects, it is the intent of the General Assembly that the interest on such bonds shall not be included in gross
6 income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Code, and the United States Treasury Regulations
7 (the Regulations) thereunder as they may be promulgated from time to time, or shall be qualified as Build America
8 Bonds pursuant to the Code and the Regulations. Pursuant to the State's budget and financial policies, other than
9 unexpected situations where surplus revenues render bond financing unnecessary or undesirable, no funds other than
10 the proceeds of such bonds, are or are reasonably expected to be, reserved, allocated on a long-term basis or
11 otherwise set aside by the State to pay the costs of such specific capital projects. Pursuant to the Authority’s budget
12 and financial policies, it is expected that approximately 50 percent of the costs of its capital projects shall be funded
13 on a long-term basis from the proceeds of such bonds. However, after the authorization of such bonds, but prior to
14 their issuance, non-bond funds from the State’s General Fund or the Authority’s Transportation Trust Fund or other
15 funds may be advanced on a temporary basis to pay a portion of the costs of such specific capital projects. In that
16 event, it is expected that these non-bond funds will be reimbursed from the proceeds of such bonds when they are
17 issued. This reimbursement may cause a portion of such bonds to become reimbursement bonds within the meaning
18 of Section 1.150-2 of the Regulations. Under those Regulations, to preserve the exclusion of the interest on such
19 bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes, it may be necessary to make a declaration of official intent.
20 The Secretary of Finance is hereby designated as the appropriate representative of the State and the Secretary of
21 Transportation is hereby designated as the appropriate representative of the Authority, and each is authorized to
22 declare official intent on behalf of the State or the Authority, as the case may be, within the meaning of Section
23 1.150-2 of the Regulations, whenever and to the extent that such declaration is required to preserve such tax
24 treatment.
25 Section 67. Amortization Requirements. Issuance of any bonds authorized in this Act or any previous
26 authorization act may be subject to any amortization requirements as shall be determined by the bond issuing officers
27 notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in 29 Del. C. § 7406(b).

3 The reserve funds shall be invested with other State funds in accordance with the guidelines established by the Cash
4 Management Policy Board. The special fund shall receive interest at the school and special fund rate approved by the
5 Cash Management Policy Board. The State Treasurer shall release custody of the reserve funds upon receipt of

1 JUDICIAL
2 Section 19. Court Facilities Improvement Working Group. Recognizing that there are critical unmet
3 court space needs statewide, including addressing operational deficiencies of the Family Court facilities in Sussex and
4 Kent Counties, and other downstate court facilities, as identified in the Southern Court Facilities Space Study
5 (October 31, 2006), a court facilities improvement working group shall be established, consisting of representatives
6 from the Judicial Branch, the Office of the Governor, the Office of Management and Budget, including Facilities
7 Management, and the Office of the Controller General, to develop a plan for implementing flexible, cost-effective
8 and potentially innovative solutions to these and other court facility space issues. The working group shall engage
9 with the Delaware State Bar Association to obtain input from practitioners who practice in the affected courts
10 regarding the best manner to ensure that litigants have access to high-quality, dignified, and safe courthouses within
11 reasonable proximity to their residences, and what combination of courthouses will accomplish that goal in the
12 manner most cost-effective to taxpayers in the long term. For the same reason, the working group will obtain input
13 from other state agencies that provide services related to litigants in the affected courts, to consider whether the co-
14 location of offices would be helpful to those receiving services and be more efficient for state taxpayers in the long
15 term.
16 Section 20. Kent and Sussex County Judicial Court Facilities. (a) The Section 1 Addendum of this Act
17 includes an appropriation of $25,000,000 for Kent and Sussex Family Court Facilities. The Section 1 Addendum of 80
18 Del. Laws c. 78 and c. 299, 81 Del. Laws c. 303, 82 Del. Laws c. 86, and 83 Del. Laws c. 56, and 83 Del. Laws c. 340,
19 and 84 Del. Laws, c. 83 appropriated funding and Section 21 of 81 Del. Laws c. 59 provided spending authority to be
20 used toward preliminary costs, including planning and design, architectural and engineering work, construction costs
21 and costs associated with relocating the Department of Justice offices. Efficiencies shall be achieved in this process
22 through the combining of planning, design, architectural and engineering work for both facilities, in all circumstances
23 where combined efforts are appropriate and will likely achieve cost savings to the overall project.
24 (b)(a) Of this the amount, $3,610,000 appropriated in Section 1 Addendum of 83 Del. Laws c. 340, a portion
25 shall be used for the acquisition of tax parcel ID # 135-19.08-154.00, 135-19.08-146.01, and 135-15.17-148.00 for

28 from these appropriations may be used for the renovations of the Customs House and/or the Old Kent/Sussex Family
29 Courthouses.

1 OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET
2 Section 21. Construction Management. Notwithstanding any other state law, the Office of Management
3 and Budget shall be responsible for the design and construction of all the projects listed under Office of Management
4 and Budget in the Section 1 Addendum of this Act. For those projects that are solely for the purchase of equipment,
5 including projects that are funded in any Minor Capital Improvement (MCI) and Equipment line, the Office of
6 Management and Budget shall transfer the appropriate funding necessary to purchase the equipment to the agency for
7 which the equipment is being purchased. The appropriate amount of funding shall be determined and agreed to by
8 the Office of Management and Budget and the agency for which the equipment is being purchased by September 1 of
9 each fiscal year. For those projects for which the appropriation is passed to an entity and for which the State is not a
10 party to the construction contract, the Office of Management and Budget shall provide technical assistance.
11 (a) Notwithstanding any other state law, there is hereby created an Appeals Board, to be composed of the
12 Lieutenant Governor, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the Controller General. The
13 Appeals Board shall approve the use of all unencumbered monies after that project is deemed substantially complete.
14 A project shall be deemed substantially complete when the project is occupied by 75 percent of the planned tenants or
15 when deemed complete by the Appeals Board. One year after a project is deemed substantially complete, any
16 unencumbered authorization balance shall revert. In no case shall this section empower the Appeals Board to allow
17 for the expenditure of funds for uses other than for the funds authorized purpose(s). The Controller General shall
18 notify the Co-Chairs of the Joint Committee on Capital Improvements of any decisions of the Appeals Board.
19 (b) The use of MCI and Equipment funds in order to ensure completion of a Major Capital Improvement project
20 involving construction of a new facility is prohibited unless the use of such funds are necessary due to a legal
21 settlement or emergency or unforeseen conditions as determined by the Director of the Office of Management and
22 Budget, the Controller General and the Co-Chairs of the Joint Committee on Capital Improvements.
23 (c) A quarterly status report shall be submitted to the Controller General on all incomplete projects.
24 (d) No project’s budget should be increased beyond what is appropriated in any Bond and Capital Improvements
25 Act, either with special funds or private funds, unless the use of those funds is approved by the appropriate cabinet
26 secretary, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Controller General and the Co-Chairs of the
27 Joint Committee on Capital Improvements.
28 Section 22. Construction Manager. It is the intent of the General Assembly that all public works
29 projects, including all public school projects, that utilize a construction manager on the project, utilize the delivery
20

1 methodology which requires the construction manager to secure a performance and payment bond for their portion of
2 the work. All subcontractors shall be listed at the start of the project and shall provide a performance and payment
3 bond which names the construction manager and the State of Delaware as additional insureds. All provisions of 29
4 Del. C. c. 69 are in effect for projects which utilize a construction manager.
5 Section 23. Judicial Construction Oversight. It is the intent of the General Assembly that a nine-member
6 Executive Committee be created to oversee construction of new or major renovation of judicial facilities. The
7 Executive Committee shall include two members of the legislature appointed by the Co-Chairs of the Joint
8 Committee on Capital Improvements; the respective Chairs of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees; two
9 members of the Judiciary as appointed by the Chief Justice; and three members of the Executive Department to
10 include the Director of Facilities Management, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and their
11 designee. The Executive Committee shall work in conformation with existing construction oversight guidelines as
12 written in the Construction Management section of this Act. The Executive Committee is hereby empowered to:
13 (a) Select appropriate professionals necessary to program, site, design, construct, furnish and equip the
14 facility;
15 (b) Provide such oversight to ensure that the final facility provides optimal security and incorporates
16 maximum operational efficiencies both within the Judiciary and in conjunction with other criminal justice agencies;
17 (c) Ensure that new construction and/or renovations are completed on schedule; and
18 (d) Ensure that the cost of new construction and/or renovations does not exceed the authorized budget.
19 This section shall apply to the following projects: Sussex County Family Court; Kent County Family Court; and any
20 Judicial construction or renovation project requested by either the Judicial Branch or recommended by the Office of
21 Management and Budget for the Judicial Branch where the total project cost estimate exceeds $10,000,000.
22 Section 24. New Castle County Courthouses. Notwithstanding any law or local government ordinance,
23 resolution, or any deed restrictions to the contrary, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall
24 designate the name of any state-owned or state-operated courthouse or other judicial building or facility in New
25 Castle County purchased, constructed, or improved by funds appropriated pursuant to an act of the General Assembly
26 and shall have the sole authority to approve or disapprove the placement of any statues or memorials in or on the
27 grounds of such courthouse or judicial building or facility.
28 Section 25. Card Access Security Systems. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law to the contrary, the
29 Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Safety and Homeland Security (DSHS), and the Department of
21

1 Technology and Information (DTI) shall jointly develop and maintain specifications and standards for card access
2 security systems for all state facilities. Security system communications using state infrastructure will observe
3 enterprise standards and policies as defined by DTI pursuant to 29 Del. C. c. 90C. The specifications and standards
4 shall enable a single-card security solution for all state-owned facilities, require the ability for concurrent central and
5 local administration of card access functions and shall include a registry of approved card readers and associated
6 hardware required to implement card access security systems. It is the intent of this section to authorize the Office of
7 Management and Budget, DSHS, and DTI to jointly select a single supplier, manufacturer or technology of access
8 cards and security management software for use by all state agencies. The Office of Management and Budget, DSHS,
9 and DTI shall develop procedures and standards required for the evaluation and approval of agency requests for new
10 or modified security systems of any type. Before a state agency may install a new security system or modify an
11 existing system, the agency shall obtain the approval of the Office of Management and Budget, DSHS, and DTI.
12 Section 26. Design-Build Contracts. The Office of Management and Budget is hereby authorized to
13 utilize or approve the design-build contract mechanism for up to twelve construction projects that are deemed
14 necessary by the Director for the efficient construction and improvement of state facilities. Design-build is a project
15 delivery method under which a project owner, having defined its initial expectations to a certain extent, executes a
16 single contract for both architectural/engineering services and construction. The selection processes and other terms
17 of such contracts may vary considerably from project to project. The design-build entity may be a single firm, a
18 consortium, joint venture, or other organization. However, the fundamental element of design-build delivery remains
19 that one entity assumes primary responsibility for design and construction of the project. The Office of Management
20 and Budget is authorized to use this approach in completing its projects, subject to the following conditions:
21 (a) The contract terms shall include provisions to pay the prevailing wage rates determined by the
22 Department of Labor, as provided in 29 Del. C. § 6960, in conjunction with federal prevailing wage rates for such
23 work;
24 (b) The following additional provisions of 29 Del. C. c. 69 shall also be incorporated into these design-build
25 contracts: § 6962(d)(4)a. (anti-pollution, conservation environmental measures or Energy Star Equipment not covered
26 by contract specifications); § 6962(d)(7) (equality of employment opportunity); and § 6962(d)(8)(9) (bonding
27 requirements); and
28 (c) Any such contracts using federal funding shall conform to all applicable federal laws and regulations
29 concerning design-build contracting.
22

1 (d) The Section 1 Addendum of this Act makes an appropriation funding for a renovation project at 704 N.
2 King Street. This project shall be designated as a design-build project.
3 (e) All other provisions of 29 Del. C. c. 69 shall not be applicable to these projects.
4 Section 27. Carvel State Office Building. As office space becomes available on the 6th floor of the Carvel
5 State Office Building, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall consider Legislative space needs
6 when reallocating available space.
7 Section 28. 312 Cherry Lane. The use of 312 Cherry Lane, New Castle, located in Riveredge Industrial
8 Park, being tax parcel 10-015.40-371, as it relates to zoning, subdivision, parking approvals, land development,
9 construction, permitting, and code enforcement, shall not be subject to the jurisdiction of New Castle County or any
10 other municipality, provided that it or a portion thereof, is leased by the State of Delaware or an agency thereof,
11 including if it is thereafter subleased to a private provider, as a medically assisted treatment facility for drug and other
12 addiction services, including any ancillary related uses such as offices or other treatment programs.
13 Section 29. Emily P. Bissell. An advisory committee shall be convened as necessary for the purpose of
14 maintaining communications between the state entities and neighboring communities of the Emily P. Bissell site. The
15 advisory committee shall consist of the following individuals:
16 (1) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget or their designee.
17 (2) The Controller General or their designee.
18 (3) The Secretary of State or their designee.
19 (4) The Secretary of the Department Safety and Homeland Security or their designee.
20 (5) One member of the House of Representatives chosen by the Speaker of the House.
21 (6) One member of the Delaware State Senate chosen by the President Pro Tempore.
22 (7) Two members of the public appointed by the Governor representing the surrounding area.
23 The Office of Management and Budget is authorized to expend Minor Capital Improvements funds
24 authorized in the Section 1 Addendum to support this process.
25 The Office of Management and Budget is authorized to utilize any residual funds appropriated to the Office
26 of Management and Budget, Division of Facilities Management capital projects toward the Emily P. Bissell
27 renovation.
28 Section 30. Fund Recoveries. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Delaware Law or this Act to the
29 contrary, pursuant to federal rules and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, all records
23

1 and expenditures are subject to a review or audit conducted by, or on behalf of, the U.S. Department of Treasury, the
2 State Auditor’s Office or designee. Any misrepresentation, misuse, or mishandling of these funds may be subject to
3 claw-back and other appropriate measures, including the possible reduction or withholding of other State funds.
4 Section 31. Land and Building Acquisition. Notwithstanding the provisions of 29 Del. C. c. 95 to the
5 contrary, the Office of Management and Budget, Division of Facilities Management is hereby authorized to acquire
6 land, buildings, and assets as necessary for capital improvement projects and to reduce leased property, with the
7 approval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Co-Chairs of the Joint Committee on Capital
8 Improvements, and the Controller General.
9 Section 32. IPA Clean Water Infrastructure. Section 1 Addendum of 83 Del. Laws c. 340 appropriated
10 $1,770,000 to the Office of Management and Budget. This funding is intended to be used to provide technical grant
11 assistance to local governments related to infrastructure initiatives and other competitive and formula grant
12 opportunities available. Funds may be made available to the University of Delaware, Institute for Public
13 Administration (IPA), Biden School of Public Policy and Administration for direct services to governments at
14 $354,000 annually for a five-year term. The University of Delaware may not charge an overhead or administrative
15 fee to the state in relation to this program.
16 Section 33. Community Workforce Agreement – Office of Management and Budget. The Office of
17 Management and Budget (OMB) is authorized to engage in a pilot program to include Community Workforce
18 Agreements as part of large public works projects. There will be two different approaches: 1) Community Workforce
19 projects and 2) Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE). The pilot program shall include no more than four
20 projects.
21 For the three Community Workforce projects, the awarded contractors for the projects will be required to
22 enter into a Community Workforce Agreement with the agency. The Community Workforce Agreement shall permit
23 all contractors to subcontract project work or to retain a percentage of their current workforce in order to meet the
24 requirements of the pilot. OMB shall set the percentage of work for each project to be performed by local labor
25 organization(s). To achieve the percentages for the projects, the awarded contractors will either hold a separate
26 contract containing a Collective Bargaining Agreement, contract with a subcontractor that holds a Collective
27 Bargaining Agreement, or enter into arrangements with local labor organizations that permit the contractors to hire
28 union workers. In addition, the Community Workforce Agreement may include a minority workforce requirement.
24

1 For the Community Workforce projects, the contract award will be based on a form of best value, for which,
2 29 Del. C. § 6962 (d)(13)a.4. is waived. OMB will establish a best value process, which may include the price,
3 schedule, and method of complying with the specific requirements of the Community Workforce projects. All bids
4 are subject to an evaluation for responsiveness and responsibility.

19 bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes, it may be necessary to make a declaration of official intent.

21 Transportation is hereby designated as the appropriate representative of the Authority, and each is authorized to
22 declare official intent on behalf of the State or the Authority, as the case may be, within the meaning of Section
