WHEREAS, Leading Youth Through Empowerment (LYTE) is a Delaware-based nonprofit organization committed to increasing access to top-performing high schools and higher education for students from low-income backgrounds through personal mentoring, rigorous academic instruction, and leadership development; and WHEREAS, since its founding in 2013, LYTE has served hundreds of students from middle schools and over 35 high schools across all three counties in Delaware, with 100% of LYTE Scholars graduating high school on time and attending college â many as first-generation college students; and WHEREAS, over 75% of LYTE Scholars come from low-to-moderate income households, and more than 50% of their families live below the poverty line, underscoring the importance of LYTEâs role in closing opportunity gaps; and WHEREAS, students credit LYTE with helping them discover previously unknown academic programs, build confidence in the classroom, and achieve stronger academic outcomes through personalized tutoring, structured mentorship, and a culture that affirms their voices and goals; and WHEREAS, LYTE further cultivates transformational experiences by connecting students with professors, professionals, and real-world opportunities such as college coursework, business school visits, and campus immersion programs that help students see their place in academic and professional spaces previously seen as inaccessible; and WHEREAS, LYTE Scholars have earned millions of dollars in scholarships and financial aid, and have been accepted to institutions such as Cornell University, Swarthmore College, the University of Virginia, Delaware State University, and the University of Delaware; and WHEREAS, LYTEâs programming offers much more than academic support â it empowers students to grow socially and emotionally, connects them with over 100 paid internships across eight career pipelines, and encourages them to envision futures beyond what they may have thought possible while fostering agency, self-expression, and long-term success; and WHEREAS, LYTE helps students feel seen, heard, and valued, providing opportunities to explore college campuses, participate in pre-college programs, and discover career pathways that spark their passions and build their confidence as leaders in their communities; and WHEREAS, LYTE fosters a culture of hope and belonging, where students are reminded that with the right guidance and lasting support, they are capable of achieving more than they ever imagined, and are equipped for success both in and beyond the classroom through the development of resilience, collaboration, and responsibility; and WHEREAS, establishing a dedicated âLYTE Dayâ not only celebrates the remarkable accomplishments of the scholars, staff, and mentors who make up this community, but also affirms Delawareâs ongoing commitment to educational equity, youth empowerment, and investing the next generation of leaders; and WHEREAS, recognizing âLYTE Dayâ thereby invites the broader Delaware community to show up for students, raise awareness about the barriers they face, and invest in a future where every young person has the resources, relationships, and opportunities they need to thrive. NOW, THEREFORE: BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the 153rd General Assembly of the State of Delaware, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the General Assembly hereby recognizes May 13, 2025, as âLYTE Dayâ in the State of Delaware.
