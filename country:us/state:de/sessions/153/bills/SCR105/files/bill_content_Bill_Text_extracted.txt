Legislation Document SPONSOR: Sen.Â Buckson & Rep.Â MichaelÂ Smith Sens. Lawson, Pettyjohn, Wilson; Rep. Bolden DELAWARE STATE SENATE 153rd GENERAL ASSEMBLY SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 105 URGING GOVERNOR MEYER TO SUBMIT A WAIVER REQUEST TO THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE TO PROHIBIT THE USE OF SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (SNAP) BENEFITS FOR THE PURCHASE OF CANDY AND SODA IN ORDER TO ADVANCE NUTRITIONAL GOALS AND IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH OUTCOMES. WHEREAS, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) was created to improve the nutrition and health of low-income individuals and families by providing access to healthy food options; and WHEREAS, current federal SNAP guidelines allow recipients to purchase not only nutritious items like fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins, but also unhealthy products such as candy and sugar-sweetened beverages; and WHEREAS, excessive consumption of added sugars is a leading contributor to chronic health conditions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, which place a significant burden on both families and the health care system; and WHEREAS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that children in the United States consume an average of 17 teaspoons of added sugar per day, far exceeding the USDAâs recommendation that added sugar should make up no more than 10 percent of daily caloric intake; and WHEREAS, several states, including Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, and West Virginia, have submitted waivers to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) seeking to prohibit the use of SNAP benefits to purchase soda and candy; and WHEREAS, experts agree that removing soda and candy from the list of allowable SNAP purchases could lead to improved public health outcomes by encouraging healthier food choices among recipients; and WHEREAS, this policy change would not reduce the amount of SNAP benefits a household receives, but rather would ensure those benefits are used to support nutritional well-being and long-term health; and WHEREAS, Delaware has an opportunity to join a growing movement of states that are working to improve diet-related health outcomes and reduce taxpayer-funded purchases of non-nutritive âjunk foodâ through targeted reforms to SNAP. NOW, THEREFORE: BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the 153 rd General Assembly of the State of Delaware, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that Governor Meyer is hereby urged to submit a formal waiver request to the United States Department of Agriculture to prohibit the use of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits for the purchase of candy and soda, in order to strengthen the programâs nutritional impact and promote the long-term health of Delawareans. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the General Assembly encourages the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services to collaborate with relevant stakeholders, including public health experts and community organizations, to support nutritional education and outreach for SNAP recipients, particularly in preparation for any policy changes. SYNOPSIS This resolution urges Governor Meyer to submit a waiver request to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) seeking to prohibit the use of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits for the purchase of candy and sugar-sweetened beverages. The resolution aligns with similar efforts in other states to promote healthier food choices among SNAP recipients and to ensure that taxpayer-funded nutrition programs support the health and well-being of low-income individuals and families. By eliminating âjunk foodsâ from the list of eligible purchases, Delaware can take a meaningful step toward reducing diet-related chronic illnesses and strengthening the nutritional integrity of the SNAP program.
