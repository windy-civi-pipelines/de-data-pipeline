      "abstract": "This Act clarifies how a period of time is calculated under the Manufactured Homes and Manufactured Home Communities Act (Chapter 70 of Title 25), a landlord\u2019s maintenance responsibilities in a manufactured home community, and that business invitees are not a \u201cguest\u201d or \u201cvisitor\u201d of the tenant or resident. \r\n\r\nUnder current law, \u00a7 7002(c) of Title 25, a designated period of time under Chapter 70 of Title 25 does not include weekends and legal holidays if the period of time is less than 7 days under \u00a7 5112 of Title 25. This Act changes how a period of time is calculated so that weekends and legal holidays are not counted if the period of time is 12 days or less. \r\n\r\nThis Act also requires that a landlord maintain all of the following:\r\n1. Bulkheads, streets, and other grounds to prevent the accumulation of standing water, as permitted by law.\r\n2. All utilities and services provided by the landlord up to the physical connection to the home.\r\n3. The root system, limbs, and trunk or stem of trees in common areas.\r\n\r\nThis Act also updates the required standards for tree care to the generally accepted industry standards for tree care, the ANSI A300 Tree Care standards, because the American Association of Nurserymen ceased to exist on January 1, 2014. The ANSI A300 Tree Care standards are voluntary industry consensus standards developed by the Tree Care Industry Association and written by the Accredited Standards Institute.\r\n\r\nThis Act also makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual."
