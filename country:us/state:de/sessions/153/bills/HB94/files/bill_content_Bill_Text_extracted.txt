This Act does not restrict State or local law enforcement from cooperating in activities related to criminal immigration enforcement matters. This Act does not create any liability for State or local law enforcement. This Act is a substitute for and differs from HB 94 by broadening the types of facilities where state and local police or constable cooperation in civil law enforcement is limited and defining definitions of those facility types. This substitute also imposes a 48 hour deadline on the AG to respond to requests for cooperation and clarifies that if a request is not responded to within that time the request is authorized.
