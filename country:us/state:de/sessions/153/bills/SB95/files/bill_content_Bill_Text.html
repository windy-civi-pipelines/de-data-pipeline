Amended Â§ 115 permits the designation of any judicial or arbitral forum so long as the designation does not prevent a stockholder from bringing claims in a court with jurisdiction in this State.

The Salzberg decision relied on similar language from Â§ 102(b)(1) to uphold the validity of forum selection provisions related to certain intra-corporate affairs claims. It is anticipated that the courts will interpret and apply amended Â§ 115 in the same manner that the Delaware Supreme Court interpreted and applied the language of Â§ 102(b)(1) in the Salzberg decision.

Fisher, 70 F.4th 1129 (9th Cir. 2023), and the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas in Sobel v. Thompson, 2023 WL 4356066 (W.D. Tex. July 5, 2023). In these decisions, the courts upheld the application of a forum selection bylaw that required all derivative claims to be asserted exclusively in the Court of Chancery, including derivative claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. However, the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction over Securities Exchange Act claims. Under amended Â§ 115, a forum selection provision that purports to address derivative claims under federal law must be permissible under Â§ 115, consistent with the reasoning in the Salzberg decision, and must also permit the claim to be brought in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.</span>
