Amended Â§ 15-111(e) specifies that a registered agent may not perform its duties or functions solely through the use of a virtual office, the retention by the agent of a mail forwarding service, or both. Amended Â§ 15-111(e) defines âvirtual officeâ as the performance of duties or functions solely through the internet or solely through other means of remote communication.</span>

The amendment confirms that, in addition to correcting a previously filed statement or certificate, a statement or certificate of correction may nullify a previously filed statement or certificate by specifying the inaccuracy or defect with respect to such previously filed statement or certificate and providing that the previously filed statement or certificate is nullified. Such a provision is sufficient if it states that the previously filed statement or certificate is nullified or void or uses words of similar meaning.</span>

This Section also amends Â§ 15-202(g) to provide that ratification or waiver pursuant to Â§ 15-202(g) may be express or implied, including by the statements, action, inaction, or acquiescence of or by partners or other persons. Further, this Section amends Â§ 15-202(g) to clarify that in a circumstance in which Â§ 15-202(g) requires notice of the ratification or waiver to be given, the giving of the notice is not a condition to the effectiveness of the ratification or waiver. The amendments to Â§ 15-202(g) in this Section are intended to provide rules different from the rules applied in existing case law that Â§ 18-106(e) of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, which is the same in all material respects as Â§ 15-202(g), is limited to ratification or waiver of a limited liability companyâs own acts and transactions and that Â§ 18-106(e) of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act does not apply to ratification or waiver by conduct.</span>

This Section also amends Â§ 15-1102(a) to clarify that the number of partners required to be stated in a statement of foreign qualification is the number of partners of the foreign limited liability partnership at the time of the effectiveness of the statement of foreign qualification.</span>
