      "abstract": "This Act continues the practice of amending periodically the Delaware Revised Uniform Partnership Act (\u201cGP Act\u201d) to keep it current and to maintain its national preeminence. The following is a section-by-section review of proposed amendments to the GP Act.\r\n\r\nSection 1 amends \u00a7 15-111(e) of the GP Act, which addresses certain duties of a registered agent of a partnership. Amended \u00a7 15-111(e) specifies that a registered agent may not perform its duties or functions solely through the use of a virtual office, the retention by the agent of a mail forwarding service, or both. Amended \u00a7 15-111(e) defines \u201cvirtual office\u201d as the performance of duties or functions solely through the internet or solely through other means of remote communication.\r\n\r\nSection 2 amends \u00a7 15-118(a) of the GP Act, which provides for the correction of statements and certificates filed with the Secretary of State. The amendment confirms that, in addition to correcting a previously filed statement or certificate, a statement or certificate of correction may nullify a previously filed statement or certificate by specifying the inaccuracy or defect with respect to such previously filed statement or certificate and providing that the previously filed statement or certificate is nullified. Such a provision is sufficient if it states that the previously filed statement or certificate is nullified or void or uses words of similar meaning.\r\n\r\nSection 3 amends \u00a7 15-202(g) of the GP Act to provide that \u00a7 15-202(g) applies to ratification or waiver of a void or voidable act or transaction by any partner or other person in respect of a partnership, in addition to acts or transactions by a partnership. This Section also amends \u00a7 15-202(g) to provide that ratification or waiver pursuant to \u00a7 15-202(g) may be express or implied, including by the statements, action, inaction, or acquiescence of or by partners or other persons. Further, this Section amends \u00a7 15-202(g) to clarify that in a circumstance in which \u00a7 15-202(g) requires notice of the ratification or waiver to be given, the giving of the notice is not a condition to the effectiveness of the ratification or waiver. The amendments to \u00a7 15-202(g) in this Section are intended to provide rules different from the rules applied in existing case law that \u00a7 18-106(e) of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, which is the same in all material respects as \u00a7 15-202(g), is limited to ratification or waiver of a limited liability company\u2019s own acts and transactions and that \u00a7 18-106(e) of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act does not apply to ratification or waiver by conduct.\r\n\r\nSection 4 amends \u00a7 15-902(c) of the GP Act to provide that a statement of partnership existence must be attached to a certificate of consolidation for a consolidation in which the resulting entity from such consolidation is a domestic partnership.\r\n\r\nSection 5 amends \u00a7 15-1102(a) of the GP Act to require that a statement of foreign qualification of a foreign limited liability partnership include the state, territory, possession or other jurisdiction or country where the foreign limited liability partnership was formed, the date of its formation and a statement from a partner that, as of the date of filing, the foreign limited liability partnership validly exists as a limited liability partnership under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation. This Section also amends \u00a7 15-1102(a) to clarify that the number of partners required to be stated in a statement of foreign qualification is the number of partners of the foreign limited liability partnership at the time of the effectiveness of the statement of foreign qualification.\r\n\r\nSection 6 amends \u00a7 15-1208(b) of the GP Act to confirm that if a statement of partnership existence will be cancelled pursuant to the filing of a statement or certificate under the GP Act, the full amount of the annual tax for the calendar year in which the statement or certificate becomes effective is due and payable before the filing of such statement or certificate.\r\n\r\nSection 7 provides that the amendments to the GP Act take effect on August 1, 2025."
