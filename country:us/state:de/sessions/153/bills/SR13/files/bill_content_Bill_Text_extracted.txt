WHEREAS, access to affordable and stable housing is critical to the well-being of Delaware's residents and communities; and WHEREAS, nationally, business entities such as limited liability companies (LLCs), corporations, and private equity firms have increasingly acquired significant shares of single-family homes, with estimates indicating that such entities accounted for approximately 18% of single-family home purchases in the United States in recent years; and WHEREAS, these business entity purchases have been linked to rising housing costs, reduced availability of homes for owner-occupants, and potential impacts on neighborhood stability and affordability; and WHEREAS, despite these national trends, the extent of business entity involvement in purchasing residential real estate in Delaware remains unclear and has not been comprehensively documented; and WHEREAS, the State currently lacks a publicly available, detailed analysis of the volume, geographic distribution, and nature of business entity ownership of residential housing stock; and WHEREAS, obtaining a clear understanding of business entity ownership patterns within the State will assist in developing informed strategies to ensure equitable access to housing. NOW, THEREFORE: BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the 153rd General Assembly of the State of Delaware that the Department of Finance is directed to provide a report detailing the extent to which business entities have purchased residential housing stock in the State over the past five years.

Whether the purchaser was a business entity or an individual. 3. The type of housing that was purchased. 4. The county in which the sale took place. 5. Recommendations for streamlining the collection and availability of this data. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Department of Finance shall collaborate as necessary with relevant stakeholders, including the counties, in the preparation of this report.
