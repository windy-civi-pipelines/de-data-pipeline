Legislation Document SPONSOR: Rep.Â Burns & Sen.Â Hansen Reps. Morrison, Osienski, Phillips, Heffernan, Lambert; Sens. Sokola, Sturgeon HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 153rd GENERAL ASSEMBLY HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 3 DIRECTING ALL ELECTRIC UTILITIES IN DELAWARE TO PARTICIPATE IN AN ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL FOR ADOPTION OF GRID-ENHANCING TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING BENEFITS, COST BURDENS AND COST SHIFTING, FEASIBILITY AND BARRIERS TO ADOPTION UNDERTAKEN BY THE DNREC STATE ENERGY OFFICE AND THE DELAWARE SUSTAINABLE ENERGY UTILITY. WHEREAS, grid-enhancing technologies (GETs), including advanced transmission technologies, non-wires alternatives to distribution system improvements, demand response programs and advanced reconductoring, the energy efficiency tools of the power grid, can help increase the capacity of the grid faster and without building new lines; and WHEREAS, a study has shown that the impact of GETs showed nationwide benefits such as doubling the amount of renewables that can be integrated into the grid prior to building new large-scale transmission lines; and WHEREAS, GET integration is estimated to create approximately 330,000 local construction jobs and 20,000 high-paying operations jobs; and WHEREAS, a study has shown that reconductoring transmission lines could add about 64 Terawatt (TW) miles of new interzonal transmission capacity by 2035 compared to about 16 TW miles from only building new transmission lines and would allow the United States to get 90% of its electricity from emissions-free power sources by 2035; and WHEREAS, several states including Colorado, Minnesota, Montana, Utah, and Virginia have enacted or advanced legislation to improve transmission infrastructure and integrate grid-enhancing technologies. NOW, THEREFORE: BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives and the Senate of the 153rd General Assembly, with the approval of the Governor, that the Delaware State Energy Office within the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (âDNREC SEOâ) and the Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility (âDESEUâ) are requested to complete a study and analysis of grid-enhancing technologies across all electric utilities in Delaware, including the projected benefits and or costs to ratepayers, technical feasibility, barriers to adoption, and reasonable ways to implement GETs. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that both wire based and non-wire based technologies should be analyzed for their ability to increase the safety, resilience, and reliability of the Delaware electricity grid while reducing the cost of electricity for all of its electricity consumers. Technologies, practices, and programs employing these technologies may include dynamic line ratings, dynamic transformer ratings, power flow controls, topology optimization, advanced conductor technologies, energy storage system deployment, and demand response (DR). DR technologies to be studied may include bidirectional car and home battery controllers integrated with smart grid controls to enable vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid technologies. These technologies allow for the use of home and electric vehicle batteries to supply energy back to the grid in direct load control programs which provide the ability for utilities to cycle appliances on and off during periods of peak demand in exchange for a financial incentive and lower electric bills. The value and feasibility of implementing solar smart inverter settings of existing and new solar installations, which can provide a range of grid support functions with or without attached batteries, will also be considered. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that application of GETs to both distribution and transmission shall be considered in this study. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the DNREC SEO and DESEU must work with the electric utilities, the Public Service Commission, the Division of the Public Advocate, and other interested stakeholders. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that all electric utilities are required to participate in the DNREC SEO/DESEU study and analysis. The DNREC SEO shall coordinate with the utilities to obtain information and feedback on the feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and integration potential of various technologies considering each utilityâs operational standards and planning cycles. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that any future implementation of GETs will be subject to the oversight and approval of the utilitiesâ respective regulatory authorities. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, no later than December 31, 2025, the DNREC SEO and DESEU shall submit a preliminary progress report detailing the initial findings from the analysis of grid-enhancing technologies across all electric utilities in Delaware, and a final report must be submitted by July 31, 2026, to the following: the Governor and all members of the General Assembly, with copies to the Director and the Librarian of the Division of Research of Legislative Council, and the Delaware Public Archives. SYNOPSIS Grid-enhancing technologies (GETs) offer efficient tools to increase power grid capacity without the need for new transmission lines. Studies demonstrate that these innovations can double renewable energy integration, create hundreds of thousands of jobs, and significantly expand interzonal transmission capacity. By 2035, GETs and reconductoring could help the U.S. achieve 90% emissions-free electricity. This resolution directs the DNREC State Energy Office (DNREC SEO) and the Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility (DESEU) to conduct a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of GETs across all electric utilities in Delaware. The study shall assess ratepayer costs, technical feasibility, and implementation plans. DNREC SEO and DESEU are tasked with collaborating with the electric utilities, the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, the Division of the Public Advocate, and other interested stakeholders and must submit a detailed preliminary report of its findings to the Governor and all members of the General Assembly by December 31, 2025, and a final report by July 31, 2026.
