A member of the House of Representatives shall resign as a member of the House of Representatives before being eligible as a candidate for a different elected office. A member of the Senate shall resign as a member of the Senate before being eligible as a candidate for a different elected office. Elected office includes the office of the Governor, the Lieutenant-Governor, the General Assembly, and any other state, county, or municipal position that is selected by voters in an election in this State. Section 2. Amend Article III of the Delaware Constitution by making deletions as shown by strike through and insertions as shown by underline as follows: Â§ 11A. Candidates for election. A person holding elected office within the State, other than the Governor or Lieutenant-Governor, shall resign from that elected office before being eligible as a candidate for a different elected office. Elected office includes, the General Assembly, and any other state, county, or municipal position that is selected by voters in an election in this State. SYNOPSIS This Act is the first leg of a constitutional amendment that requires a person holding elected office to resign from office before being eligible as a candidate for a different elected office. Elected office includes the office of the Governor, the Lieutenant-Governor, the General Assembly, and any other state, county, or municipal position that is selected by voters in an election in this State. The Governor and Lieutenant-Governor, however, are not required to resign from office should they run for a different elected office. This Act requires a greater than majority vote for passage because Â§ 1 of Article XVI of the Delaware Constitution requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members elected to each house of the General Assembly to amend the Delaware Constitution.
