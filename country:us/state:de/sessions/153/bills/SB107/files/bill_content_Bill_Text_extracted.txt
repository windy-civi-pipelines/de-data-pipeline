Upon enactment by the seventh state, the Secretary of the Department of Education shall provide notice published in the Register of Regulations that the Interstate Compact for School Psychologists has been adopted by 7 states. SYNOPSIS This Act enacts the Interstate Compact for School Psychologists (âCompactâ), which is designed to facilitate the interstate practice of school psychology in educational settings. School-based mental health services are in high demand in Delaware, but workforce shortages can make it difficult to meet that demand. By creating an additional licensing pathway for school psychologists to obtain equivalent licenses to practice school psychology in any state that is a member of the Compact, the Act aims to increase the availability of school psychological services for students in this State. The Interstate Compact for School Psychologists must be enacted in 7 states to become effective. The Compact has been enacted in 2 states and legislation is pending in several others.

Failure to provide the Commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated rules. (b) Default, technical assistance, and termination. (1) If the Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated rules, the Commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the Commission may take, and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the default. (2) The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states. (c) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from this Compact upon an affirmative vote of a supermajority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that state by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default. (d) Termination of membership in this Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting stateâs legislature, the defaulting stateâs licensing authority and each of the member statesâ licensing authorities. (e) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination. (f) Upon the termination of a stateâs membership from this Compact, that state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state of such termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of 6 months after the date of said notice of termination. (g) The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from this Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting state. (h) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneyâs fees. (i) Dispute resolution. (1) Upon request by a member state, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to this Compact that arise among member states and between member and non-member states. (2) The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate. (j) Enforcement. (1) By majority vote as provided by rule, the Commission may initiate legal action against a member state in default in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of this Compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneyâs fees. These remedies shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member stateâs law. (2) A member state may initiate legal action against the Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of this Compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneyâs fees. (3) No person other than a member state shall enforce this Compact against the Commission. Â§ 8252. Effective date, withdrawal, and amendment. (a) This Compact shall come into effect on the date on which this Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state. (1) On or after the effective date of this Compact indicated above, the Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the charter member states to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than the model compact statute. a. A Charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model Compact statute shall be entitled to the default process set forth in Â§ 8251 of this title. b. If any member state is later found to be in default, or is terminated or withdraws from this Compact, the Commission shall remain in existence and this Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of member states should be less than seven. (2) Member states enacting this Compact subsequent to the charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth in Â§ 8248(c)(21) of this title to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model Compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in this Compact. (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of this Compact prior to the effective date of this Compact or the Commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the Commission unless specifically repudiated by the Commission. a. Any state that joins this Compact subsequent to the Commissionâs initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which this Compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day this Compact becomes law in that state. b. Any member state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the same. (b) A member stateâs withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days after enactment of the repealing statute. (c) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing stateâs licensing authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal. (d) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this Compact, a state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of 6 months after the date of such notice of withdrawal. (1) Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a non-member state that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact. (2) This Compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states. Â§ 8253. Construction and severability. (a) This Compact and the Commissionâs rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and administration of this Compact. Provisions of this Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the Commissionâs rulemaking authority solely for those purposes. (b) The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, a state seeking participation in this Compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, the Commission may deny a stateâs participation in this Compact or, in accordance with the requirements of Â§ 8251(b) of this title, terminate a member stateâs participation in this Compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure from this Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters. Â§ 8254. Consistent effect and conflict with other state laws. (a) Nothing in this section shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with this Compact. (b) Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a member state in conflict with this Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict. (c) All permissible agreements between the Commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms. Section 2. This Act takes effect upon the enactment of the Interstate Compact for School Psychologists by the seventh state. Upon enactment by the seventh state, the Secretary of the Department of Education shall provide notice published in the Register of Regulations that the Interstate Compact for School Psychologists has been adopted by 7 states. SYNOPSIS This Act enacts the Interstate Compact for School Psychologists (âCompactâ), which is designed to facilitate the interstate practice of school psychology in educational settings. School-based mental health services are in high demand in Delaware, but workforce shortages can make it difficult to meet that demand. By creating an additional licensing pathway for school psychologists to obtain equivalent licenses to practice school psychology in any state that is a member of the Compact, the Act aims to increase the availability of school psychological services for students in this State. The Interstate Compact for School Psychologists must be enacted in 7 states to become effective. The Compact has been enacted in 2 states and legislation is pending in several others.
