WHEREAS, the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus is a longstanding and deeply meaningful observance within the Roman Catholic Church and is also recognized by some other Christian denominations; and WHEREAS, Catholics believe the Sacred Heart of Jesus represents the boundless love, compassion, and mercy of Jesus Christ for all of humanity; and WHEREAS, the month of June holds special significance for many Catholics, as the Solemnity of the Sacred Heart is celebrated during this time; and WHEREAS, Pentecost, which will occur on Sunday, June 8, 2025, commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles and is regarded by Christians as the birth of the Church; and WHEREAS, the Feast of the Sacred Heart is traditionally observed on the Friday following the second Sunday after Pentecost, which in 2025 falls on Friday, June 27; and WHEREAS, the widespread Catholic devotion to the Sacred Heart was inspired in the 17th century by Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque, a French nun who reported a series of visions between 1673 and 1675, calling for increased reverence to the heart of Christ as a symbol of divine love; and WHEREAS, according to Catholic tradition, on June 16, 1675, Jesus revealed to Saint Margaret Mary a request to establish a feast in honor of His Sacred Heart, sparking a devotion that spread across France and eventually throughout the world; and WHEREAS, Pope Pius IX formally established the Feast of the Sacred Heart in 1865, designating the Friday following the Feast of Corpus Christi for its celebration; and WHEREAS, the roots of this devotion, as understood by Catholics, trace back to scriptural passages such as John 19:32-35, which describe Jesusâ side being pierced, symbolizing His sacrificial love for all people; and WHEREAS, the image associated with the Sacred Heartâdepicted as a heart aflame, wounded, encircled by a crown of thorns, and radiating lightâis considered by the faithful to be a powerful symbol of Christâs eternal love.
