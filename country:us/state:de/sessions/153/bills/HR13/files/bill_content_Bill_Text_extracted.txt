Legislation Document SPONSOR: Rep.Â S.Â Moore HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 153rd GENERAL ASSEMBLY HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 13 REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO STUDY AND REPORT TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY POSSIBLE CHANGES TO DELAWARE'S STUDENT ASSESSMENT SYSTEM. WHEREAS, Delaware currently administers a combination of statewide assessments, including the Smarter Balanced Assessment in elementary and middle grades and the SAT in high schools, to meet federal accountability requirements under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); and WHEREAS, Delawareâs current summative assessment model provides limited real-time instructional feedback to educators and students, often fails to accurately reflect student growth over time, and can impose significant stress on learners, particularly those with disabilities; and WHEREAS, Montana has begun to implement a through-year assessment model, the Montana Aligned to Standards Through-Year (MAST) pilot program, that provides shorter, more frequent assessments with real-time data aligned to local curricula and focused on individual student progress; and WHEREAS, MAST, also known as the Montana Alternative Student Testing program, was authorized through legislation and supported by a federal assessment innovation grant to pilot and transition to a system designed for flexibility, instructional alignment, and responsiveness to student needs; and WHEREAS, the MAST design benefits students, teachers, parents, and administrators by providing actionable data at the beginning of the school year and by providing a meaningful model of student performance over the academic school year; and WHEREAS, Delaware should examine possible state assessment alternatives, including the feasibility of a pilot program similar to MAST or a revised assessment system, that focus on learning growth and student learning disabilities. NOW, THEREFORE: BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the 153rd General Assembly of the State of Delaware that the Department of Education (Department) shall conduct a comprehensive review of alternative assessment models, including through-year and growth-based systems, with particular attention to how such systems can better serve students with learning disabilities.
