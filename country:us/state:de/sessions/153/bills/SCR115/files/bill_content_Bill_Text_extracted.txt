WHEREAS, the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (âADAâ) was passed almost 35 years ago on July 26, 1990, and fundamentally changed the way society perceives and accommodates individuals with disabilities; and WHEREAS, the ADA is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in all areas of public life, including employment, schools, transportation, and all public and private places that are open to the general public; and WHEREAS, the purpose of the law is to ensure that people with disabilities have the same rights and opportunities as all Americans without facing discrimination based on their disability; and WHEREAS, the law requires employers and government agencies to provide reasonable accommodations and accessible services to those who have disabilities; and WHEREAS, the act prohibits places of public accommodation from discriminating against individuals with disabilities and sets building, facility, transportation, and communication system accessibility standards including ramps, elevators, accessible parking spaces, Braille signage, and captioning on videos; and WHEREAS, by promoting accessibility and prohibiting discrimination, the ADA fosters a more inclusive society where individuals with disabilities can fully participate and contribute to their communities; and WHEREAS, the ADA has helped to raise awareness about the needs and rights of individuals with disabilities, challenging stereotypes and promoting a more positive and inclusive attitude towards disabilities, while setting a legal precedent for other countries to follow; and WHEREAS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (âCDCâ) estimates that approximately 26 percent of Americans, 61 million adults, have disabilities; and WHEREAS, the CDC states that up to 24 percent of Delaware residents have a disability and that disability care accounts for 34 percent of healthcare spending in Delaware; and WHEREAS, the anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act provides an opportunity for reflection on the progress made in advancing disability rights and inclusion, as well as a reminder of the work that remains to be done; and WHEREAS, the ADA has had a profound impact on the lives of millions of Americans with disabilities, empowering them to live more independently, participate fully in society, and pursue their goals and aspirations without facing discrimination or barriers. NOW, THEREFORE: BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the 153rd General Assembly of the State of Delaware, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the General Assembly affirms the importance of the recognition of people with disabilities and their many achievements, and hereby designates July 26, 2025, as âAmericans with Disabilities Act Dayâ in the State of Delaware.
