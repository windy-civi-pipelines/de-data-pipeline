      "abstract": "This Act requires additional reporting and disclosure related to the use of mechanical restraint and seclusion in public schools. \r\n\r\nWhile public school personnel cannot use mechanical restraint or seclusion on students in absence of a waiver, law-enforcement officers can. This Act requires the Department of Education to collect data from public schools about the use of mechanical restraint and seclusion, in addition to the physical restraint data that is already collected. The Department of Education shall include the mechanical restraint and seclusion data in its annual report. This Act adds a specific date by which the annual report is due. Additionally, the annual report must be submitted to certain entities, including the Delaware School Boards Association and the boards of education of school districts and the boards of directors of charter schools. \r\n\r\nThis Act also adds mechanical restraint and seclusion to the parental notice requirement and special procedures and safeguard requirements that already exist for use of physical restraint.\r\n\r\nThough \u00a7 4112F defines \u201cchemical restraint\u201d, chemical restraint cannot be performed by anyone in a public school. Therefore, this Act does not add chemical restraint to data collection, reporting, parental notification, or safeguard requirements. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, this Act adds a definition of school resource officer (SRO) to clarify that SROs are law-enforcement officers. This Act requires the Department of Education to amend its regulations in accordance with the definitions in this Act. \r\n\r\nThis Act also makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual, including correctly formatting lists and revising \u00a7 4112F(d) of Title 14, the subsection addressing particular training requirements for SROs, to account for the creation of a definition of SRO. One technical correction in \u00a7 4112F(d) is changing a \u201cshall not\u201d to a \u201cmay not\u201d as it applies to the prohibition against the use of SROs who have not complied with mandated training requirements. According to Rule 12 in the Legislative Drafting Manual, \u201cshall not\u201d should be avoided in legislative drafting. Furthermore, both \u201cmay not\u201d and \u201cmust not\u201d are proper ways to express a prohibition in the Delaware Code. They convey the same level of mandatory prohibition except that \u201cmay not\u201d qualifies a verb in active voice while \u201cmust not\u201d qualifies an inactive verb or an active verb in passive voice. This technical correction still prohibits school districts and charter schools from using an SRO who has not satisfied the training requirements in \u00a7 4112F(d).\r\n\r\nThis Act takes effect on August 1, 2025."
