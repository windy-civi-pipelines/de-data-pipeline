WHEREAS, in Delaware, Medicaid provides long-term care services that include case management, personal care services, medical and social day care, respite care, cognitive services, assisted living, mental health services, supplemental nutrition, and mechanical emergency response devices; and WHEREAS, according to a 2024 KFF survey of Medicaid Financial Eligibility & Enrollment Policies for Seniors & People with Disabilities, all states except Delaware have an income limit of 300% of SSI for Medicaid eligibility for Long Term Services and Supports (LTSS); and WHEREAS, in 2024, individuals with incomes at or below $2,829 a month were eligible for Medicaid LTSS in 49 other states and the District of Columbia, but in Delaware, only individuals with monthly incomes at or below $2,358.00 were eligible for those services; and WHEREAS, in 2025, the maximum monthly SSI payment for an individual is $967; and WHEREAS, in 2025, 300% of SSI equals $2,901 a month for an individual; and WHEREAS, Delawareâs income limit for Medicaid eligibility for LTSS is 250% of Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which is $2,417.50 a month for an individual in 2025; and WHEREAS, residents of this State would benefit from increasing the eligibility threshold for Medicaid LTSS to 300% of SSI. NOW, THEREFORE: BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the 153rd General Assembly of the State of Delaware, with the approval of the Governor, that increasing the eligibility threshold for Medicaid Long Term Services and Supports (LTSS) is good public policy because it will increase access to the services and supports and reduce the financial burden of Delawareans who need these services. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that no later than January 1, 2026, the Department of Health and Social Services must submit a Medicaid State Plan Amendment to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to increase eligibility for LTSS to 300% of Supplemental Security Income. SYNOPSIS This Senate Joint Resolution directs the Department of Health and Social Services to submit a state plan amendment increasing eligibility for Medicaid Long Term Services and Supports to 300% of SSI, which is consistent with the eligibility limit in all other states and the District of Columbia.
