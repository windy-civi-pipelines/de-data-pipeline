WHEREAS, more than 50 years ago, January was designated as âNational Blood Donor Monthâ to honor voluntary blood donors and encourage more people to donate blood, especially during times when blood supplies are historically low; and WHEREAS, the Blood Bank of Delmarva has been serving the community for over 70 years, collecting and distributing lifesaving blood and blood products to patients in local hospitals; and WHEREAS, the need for a diverse and consistent blood supply in our communities is critical, yet supplies often fall short, making volunteer blood donors the cornerstone of a safe and stable blood supply to meet the medical needs of patients nationwide; and WHEREAS, a blood transfusion occurs every 2 seconds in the United States, but only 3% of the eligible population donates blood, leading to chronic shortages that expose the vulnerabilities in the nationâs blood supply and highlight the need for inclusion in emergency preparedness plans; and WHEREAS, O-negative (O-) is the universal blood type, represented by only 6% of the population, and is frequently used in trauma situations, making it the most needed and often the most critically in short supply during blood emergencies; and WHEREAS, with the recent addition of Kent County Emergency Medical Services, the entire State of Delaware is now covered by pre-hospital whole blood services. This partnership among Blood Bank of Delmarva, the Delaware Division of Public Healthâs Office of Emergency Medical Services, New Castle County EMS, Sussex County EMS, and Kent County EMS enables trauma victims to receive lifesaving blood transfusions at the scene of emergencies, such as car accidents, before reaching the hospital, significantly improving survival rates; and WHEREAS, patients requiring blood transfusions include, among others, cancer patients, trauma victims, burn victims, newborn babies and their mothers, transplant recipients, surgical patients, and chronically transfused individuals with conditions such as sickle cell disease or thalassemia. NOW, THEREFORE: BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the 153 rd General Assembly of the State of Delaware, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the month of January 2025, is designated as âNational Blood Donor Monthâ in the State of Delaware. The General Assembly urges all citizens to support the cause of blood donation, honor voluntary blood donors for their selfless contributions, and encourage all eligible individuals to donate blood regularly. Furthermore, the General Assembly calls on businesses and organizations throughout Delaware to partner with the Blood Bank of Delmarva and other blood collection institutions to host community-based blood drives and provide opportunities for Delaware citizens to give the gift of life.
