WHEREAS, celebrated every year in April, National Minority Health Month: Builds awareness about the disproportionate burden of premature death and illness in people from racial and ethnic minority groups and encourages action through health education, early detection and control of disease complications; and WHEREAS, the origin of National Minority Health Month was the 1915 establishment of National Negro Health Week by Booker T.

Res. 388) that âa National Minority Health and Health Disparities Month should be established to promote educational efforts on the health problems currently facing minorities and other populations experiencing health disparities.â The resolution encouraged âall health organizations and Americans to conduct appropriate programs and activities to promote healthfulness in minority and other communities experiencing health disparitiesâ; and WHEREAS, significant health disparities exist among minority groups, including differences in the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of preventable health conditions and diseases which include gun violence, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, HIV/AIDS, infant mortality, maternal health, and mental health; and WHEREAS, National Minority Health Month is an inclusive initiative addressing health needs of African American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American people and other minorities with the aim of strengthening the capacities of local communities to eliminate the disproportionate burden of premature death and preventable illness in populations of color through prevention, early detection, and control of disease complications; and WHEREAS, even though improvements have been made in the health status of most Delaware residents during the past decade, the state's populations of color remain challenged by poorer rates of overall health status and higher death rates for preventable disease; and WHEREAS, public awareness and culturally relevant health education, disease prevention, and health care services are essential to improving the health of racial and ethnic minorities; and WHEREAS, in accordance with this year's National Minority Health Month theme, "Be the Source for Better Health: Improving Health Outcomes Through Our Cultures, Communities, and Connections," Delaware is focused on emphasizing âBe the Source for Better Health: Improving Health Outcomes Through Our Cultures, Communities, and Connectionsâ. NOW, THEREFORE: BE IT RESOLVED that the House of Representatives of the State of Delaware of the 153 rd General Assembly, the Senate concurring therein, does hereby proclaim the month of April 2025 as National Minority Health Month in Delaware, in support of efforts to help eliminate health disparities, accelerate health equity, and make the State of Delaware a stronger and healthier state for all.
