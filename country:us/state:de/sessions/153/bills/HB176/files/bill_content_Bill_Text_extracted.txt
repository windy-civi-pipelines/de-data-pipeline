Delaware Agricultural Equipment Right to Repair Act. Â§ 1801. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to promote equipment owner choice and competition for repair and maintenance services by requiring manufacturers of agricultural equipment to make available to owners and independent repair providers, on fair and reasonable terms, the same documentation, parts, and tools used to diagnose, maintain, and repair such equipment created by the manufacturer for the purposes of repair.

(c) No original equipment manufacturer or authorized repair provider shall be liable for any damage or injury to any agricultural equipment caused by an independent repair provider or owner which occurs during the course of repair, diagnosis, or maintenance and is not attributable to the original equipment manufacturer or authorized repair provider other than if the failure is attributable to design or manufacturing defects.Â (d) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a manufacturer to make available special documentation, tools, and parts that would disable or override anti-theft security measures set by the owner of the product without the ownerâs authorization.Â (e) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a manufacturer to sell a part if the part is no longer available to the manufacturer.Â Â (f) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a manufacturer to sell any service materials that would be illegal to use under federal or state law.Â (g) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent a parts dealer from marking up goods over the wholesale price.Â Â§ 1807.Â  Applicability.Â This chapter applies to equipment first manufactured and sold on or after the effective date of this act.
