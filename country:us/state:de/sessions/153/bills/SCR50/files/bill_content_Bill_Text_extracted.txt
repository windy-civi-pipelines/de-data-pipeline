WHEREAS, the âWeek of the Young Childâ, established by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), is an annual celebration to recognize the importance of early learning, young children, their teachers, families, and the critical early childhood programs that support them; and WHEREAS, NAEYC first established the âWeek of the Young Childâ in 1971, recognizing that the early childhood years, from birth through 8 years of age, lay the foundation for children's success in school and later life; and WHEREAS, the âWeek of the Young Childâ is a time to recognize that all children's opportunities are our responsibilities and to recommit ourselves to ensuring that every child has access to, and experiences, the type of early environment, at home, at childcare, at school, and in the community, that will promote early learning and meet the needs of all young children; and WHEREAS, the foundation for a childâs success in school and later in life is built during the early years, and investments in high-quality early childhood education yield significant returns for families, communities, and society as a whole; and WHEREAS, at birth, the average babyâs brain is about a quarter of the size of the average adult brain. Incredibly, it doubles in size in the first year and keeps growing to about 80% of adult size by age 3 and 90%, nearly full grown, by age 5; and WHEREAS, high-quality early childhood education depends on high-quality early childhood educators who ensure that children, supported by families, have the early experiences they need for a strong foundation. The âWeek of the Young Childâ thereby provides an opportunity to celebrate and recognize the dedication and hard work of early childhood educators; and WHEREAS, young children need skilled, educated, competent, consistent, and compensated early childhood educators, who reflect a rich diversity of linguistic, racial, and cultural identities. These professionals play a crucial role in laying the foundation for childrenâs future success by providing nurturing environments, stimulating learning experiences, and fostering social and emotional development; and WHEREAS, working families need an early childhood education system that allows them access to quality childcare settings and need-sufficient high-quality childcare spaces beginning at birth available in the community; and WHEREAS, Delaware is home to dedicated early childhood educators, advocates, and caregivers who play a vital role in supporting childrenâs growth, development, and well-being during their most formative years; and WHEREAS, the âWeek of the Young Childâ serves as a reminder of the importance of investing in the early years of a childâs life and working together to ensure that all children have access to the resources and support, they need to thrive. NOW, THEREFORE: BE IT RESOLVED that the Senate of the 153rd General Assembly of the State of Delaware, the House of Representatives concurring therein, recognizes April 5 through 11, 2025, as "Week of the Young Child" in Delaware. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives hereby recognize the critical, complex, valuable, and demanding work of early childhood educators and urge all members of our community to support efforts that increase children and familiesâ access to high-quality early childhood education.
