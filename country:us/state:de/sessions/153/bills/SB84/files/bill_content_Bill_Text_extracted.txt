Under this Act, an agricultural operation cannot be deemed a nuisance as long as it is operating in accordance with all applicable local, state, and federal requirements and is not being conducted in a negligent or improper manner. This protection cannot be used against a federal, state, or local agency that is enforcing air, water quality, or other environmental standards under federal, state, or local law. This Act also makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual. Author: Senator Huxtable
