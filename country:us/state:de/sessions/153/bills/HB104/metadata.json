      "abstract": "This Act is a substitute for House Bill No. 104. This Act differs from House Bill No. 104 in that it corrects a typographical error in the Act and removes language from the synopsis that is not applicable to House Bill No. 104 or this Act.\r\n\r\nLike House Bill No. 104, this Act provides enhanced statewide jurisdiction for police officers, including county and municipal police officers. Specifically, this Act does the following:\r\n(1) Enables an off-duty police officer to make arrests for offenses committed in the officer\u2019s presence when the crime creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person.\r\n(2) Enables an off-duty police officer to make arrests for certain serious traffic offenses committed in the officer's presence.\r\n(3) Adds 3 additional traffic violations to the list of traffic violations for which a law enforcement officer may arrest for statewide when the traffic violations are committed in the officer's presence. The 3 additional traffic violations are: reckless driving, aggressive driving, and overtaking and passing a stopped school bus.\r\n(4) Requires a police officer acting outside of the officer\u2019s jurisdiction to take reasonable measures to notify the primary jurisdictional police agency as soon as practicable of the location of the crime and, if involving a stop for 1 of the 4 enumerated traffic violations, the registration number of the vehicle, description of the vehicle, and number of occupants of the vehicle.\r\n(5) Enables an off-duty police officer to make an arrest at any location in this State of an individual for any offense committed within the jurisdiction of the officer\u2019s employing agency and for whose arrest a warrant has been issued.\r\n\r\nThis Act requires a greater than majority vote for passage because \u00a7 1 of Article IX of the Delaware Constitution requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members elected to each house of the General Assembly to amend a municipal charter, whether directly, by amendment to a specific municipality\u2019s charter, or, as in this Act, indirectly, by a general law."
