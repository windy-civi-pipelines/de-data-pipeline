The Workersâ Compensation Oversight Panel may, without consent of the General Assembly and Governor, reduce reimbursements for any procedures it deems appropriate, but cannot increase reimbursements beyond the amounts permitted by this chapter. SYNOPSIS This Act provides a one-time increase of 3% in aggregate workerâs compensation medical expenses to correct reimbursements for medical services coded as evaluation and management (E&M) for worker compensation cases. This is needed as the E&M reimbursement rate for Workersâ Compensation cases has fallen below the reimbursement rate of the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services rates. This is a critical need as the State of Delaware is in critical need of physicians to accept and treat worker compensation patients. Author: Senator Walsh
