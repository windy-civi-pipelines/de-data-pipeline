The Rules of Legislative Conduct are as follows: (1) Restrictions relating to "personal or private interests" within the meaning of Article II, Section 20 of the Delaware Constitution and Chapter 10, Title 29 of the Delaware Code are as follows: a. A member who has a personal or private interest in any measure or bill pending before the House shall disclose the fact and shall not participate in the debate nor vote thereon; provided, however, that (i) upon the request of any other member of the House, a member who has such a personal or private interest may nevertheless respond to questions concerning any such measure or bill, or (ii) a member who has a personal or private interest may add factual matter to the debate which the member believes will correct wrong or false information. A personal or private interest in a measure or bill is an interest which tends to impair a memberâs independence of judgment in the performance of the memberâs legislative duties with respect to that measure or bill. b. A member has an interest which tends to impair the memberâs independence of judgment in the performance of the memberâs legislative duties with regard to any bill or measure when (i) the enactment or defeat of the measure or bill would result in a financial benefit or detriment to accrue to the member or a close relative to a greater extent than such benefit or detriment would accrue to others who are members of the same class or group of persons, (ii) the member or a close relative has a financial interest in a private enterprise which enterprise or interest would be affected by a measure or bill to a greater extent than like enterprises or other interests in the same enterprise, or (iii) a person required to register as a lobbyist pursuant to Chapter 58, Title 29 of the Delaware Code is a close relative of the legislator and that person acts to promote, advocate, influence or oppose the measure or bill. c. If the member is present, the disclosure required under paragraph a. shall be made in open session, (i) prior to the vote on the measure or the bill by any committee of which the member is a member, and (ii) prior to the vote on the measure or bill in the House. Disclosure may be made by written statement submitted to the Chairperson of a committee or the Speaker of the House and read in open session in the committee or the House as the case may be. If the member is absent when a measure or bill is voted on which would have required disclosure required under paragraph a. then the member shall make the required disclosure as soon as possible upon returning to the committee or House. d. For the purposes of this Rule: 1. A "close relative" means a personâs parents, spouse, children (natural or adopted) and siblings of the whole and half-blood. 2. A "private enterprise" means any activity, whether conducted for profit or not for profit, and includes the ownership of real or personal property; provided that "private enterprise" does not include any activity of the State of Delaware, any political subdivision or any agency, authority or instrumentality thereof. 3. A person has a "financial interest" in a private enterprise if the person (i) has a legal or equitable ownership interest in the enterprise with a fair market value in excess of $5,000, or owns more than 10% of the enterprise if not traded on an established securities market, or owns more than 1% in the case of an enterprise whose securities are regularly traded on an established securities market, (ii) is associated with the enterprise and received from the enterprise during the last calendar year or might reasonably be expected to receive from the enterprise during the current or the next calendar year income in excess of $5,000 for services as an employee, officer, director, trustee, or independent contractor, or (iii) is a creditor of an insolvent private enterprise in an amount in excess of $5,000. 4. A "person" means an individual, partnership, corporation, trust, joint venture and any other association of individuals or entities. (2) A member shall not receive unlawful gratuities in violation of Â§ 1206, Title 11 of the Delaware Code. (3) A member shall not receive a bribe in violation of Â§ 1203, Title 11 of the Delaware Code. (4) A member shall not profiteer in violation of Â§ 1212, Title 11 of the Delaware Code. (5) A member shall not engage in conduct constituting official misconduct in violation of Â§ 1211, Title 11 of the Delaware Code. (6) A member shall not fail to comply with the campaign finance disclosure requirements set forth in Chapter 80, Title 15 of the Delaware Code. (7) A member shall not fail to comply with the financial disclosure requirements of Chapter 58, Title 29 of the Delaware Code. (8) A member shall not appear for, represent, or assist another in respect to a matter before the General Assembly or one of its committees for compensation other than that provided by law. (9) A member shall not release, without authorization of the Ethics Committee, any confidential matter pertaining to proceedings of the Ethics Committee. (10) A member shall not knowingly file a false statement with the Ethics Committee or the House in connection with any proceeding involving a Rule of Legislative Conduct. (11) A member shall not engage in sexual harassment or harassment based on any protected characteristics. (12) A member shall not engage in conduct which the House determines (i) brings the House into disrepute or (ii) reflects adversely on the memberâs fitness to hold legislative office.

(c) A complaint alleging a violation of a Rule of Legislative Conduct shall be filed in writing by a member with the Ethics Committee for investigation and recommendation to the House as to disposition. A complaint must be accompanied by a written statement signed by any person, sworn under oath, setting forth the facts supporting the complaints. No such complaint shall be considered by the House prior to its consideration and recommendation by the Ethics Committee. (d) If the Ethics Committee recommends some disciplinary action with respect to a complaint, it shall present a resolution to the House requesting that the House conduct a proceeding to consider the matter. If the Ethics Committee votes to dismiss a complaint, and there are no votes against dismissal in the Committee, the House shall take no action with respect thereto. If the Ethics Committee votes to dismiss a complaint, but there are dissenting votes in the Committee, the House may consider the matter upon the motion of any member of the House, approved by a majority vote of the House. In any proceeding before the House involving an alleged violation of a Rule of Legislative Conduct, the accused member shall be given an opportunity to be heard after notice, to be advised and assisted by legal counsel, to produce witnesses, and offer evidence and to cross-examine any witnesses. A transcript of any such proceeding shall be made and retained, and rules of procedure for ethics violations as may be adopted by the House shall apply. (e) If the House finds by a majority vote that a member has violated a Rule of Legislative Conduct, it may impose such disciplinary action as it deems appropriate, provided that no member may be suspended or expelled without the vote of two-thirds of the members of the House concurring therein.

BILLS, RESOLUTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES. RULE 19 - RESOLUTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES; DEFINITIONS . (a) The following types of resolutions may be considered by this body: (1) Simple Resolutions: A Simple Resolution is an expression of a majority of members on a specific subject, and deals with the internal affairs of the House only. The effect of its passage does not go beyond the bounds and the authority of the House. (2) Concurrent Resolutions: A Concurrent Resolution is used to accomplish the same purpose in relation to the entire General Assembly that the Simple Resolution achieves for either the House or Senate singly. It must be passed by both the House and Senate to become effective. A Concurrent Resolution adopted by the General Assembly does not become a statute, nor does it have the force and effect of law, nor can it be used for any purpose which requires the exercise of legislative power. (3) Joint Resolutions: A Joint Resolution is the most formal type of resolution, and is addressed to matters which are not internal affairs of either the House individually, nor the internal affairs of the General Assembly as a whole. It is of no legal effect unless passed by both Houses and approved by the Governor. Although a Joint Resolution is not a law, it is employed to provide for temporary measures, and has the force of law while in effect for a wide variety of limited purposes. A Joint Resolution is effective only for the General Assembly in which it was passed and approved. The requirement of the Governorâs signature for Joint Resolutions stems from its original use in instances where it was expedient or necessary to express the joint will and action of the General Assembly and Governor combined. (b) Each member of the House may issue tributes and memoriams at any time during the memberâs term of office. Tributes and memoriams shall be sequentially numbered by the Chief Clerk and made a part of the House Journal. Each tribute or memoriam shall be signed by the Prime Sponsor, the Speaker and the Chief Clerk. The Speaker, or the Speakerâs designee, shall cause to be read into the permanent record of the House such tributes and memoriams as have been filed with the Chief Clerk. Tributes and memoriams shall not require a vote; however, at the time such items are officially read into the record, any member may comment on the tributes or memoriams. Tributes and memoriams issued when the House stands in recess or adjournment shall be administratively managed by the Chief Clerk, who shall cause such items to be made a part of the official proceedings of the House. (c) A measure, as used in these Rules, means a bill, resolution, amendment, motion, or other question before the House. RULE 20 - PREPARATION AND CUSTODY . (a) Each bill and resolution shall be introduced with as many backed copies as are deemed necessary by the Speaker. The original of the bill or resolution shall at all times remain in the custody of the Chief Clerk of the House or the Chair of the committee to which it has been assigned. A "duplicate" backed copy may go (on request) to the following: the Speaker, the Sponsor, and the Division of Legislative Services. Upon introduction of a bill or resolution a copy shall be delivered to every member. Copies shall also be delivered to the Division of Legislative Services. (b) No bill or joint resolution shall be introduced into the House unless it be "prefaced" by a brief statement of its purpose which shall be known as the title, and the bill or resolution shall also contain the text of such bill or resolution in full. Each bill or resolution shall have an appropriate enacting or resolving clause. If a bill by its terms requires an extraordinary majority for enactment, such vote requirement shall be announced by the Speaker prior to roll call, and such vote requirement should be plainly indicated on the bill. At the end of each bill or joint resolution introduced, the author shall include a brief synopsis of the intent of the bill or joint resolution. In the lower left hand corner of page one shall be the initials of the unit preparing the bill or resolution, the initials of the drafter, and the initials of the typist; and, if prepared by automatic equipment, the identification number. (c) If a bill or resolution provides for the appointment or selection of members to a committee, task force or similar entity, there shall be a brief synopsis of the need for the creation of the committee, task force or similar entity. A copy of such bill or resolution shall be delivered to each person who is to make an appointment or selection and delivered to any person designated in the bill or resolution to be a member of the committee, task force, or similar entity. Such bill or resolution shall contain the criteria for the selection of the Chairperson and members of the task force or similar entity. RULE 21 - INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS; FILING WITH CHIEF CLERK . (a) Each bill or resolution shall be numbered in order as introduced, beginning with HB 1 for House Bills, HR 1 for House Resolutions, HCR 1 for House Concurrent Resolutions and HJR 1 for House Joint Resolutions, and the original backer shall contain the signatures of all the Sponsors of the original bill. (b) Every bill or resolution shall be introduced by one of the following methods: (1) Filing it with the Chief Clerk of the House by noon prior to the opening of the session by either of the following procedures: a. The Sponsorâs written direction to the Chief Clerk; or b. Verbal approval from the Sponsor to the Chief Clerk (original bill must be signed by the Sponsor before start of session). (2) Introduction from the floor while the House is in session if permitted by the Speaker. (c) (1) At the beginning of the dayâs session following the filing of a bill or joint resolution with the Chief Clerk, the Chief Clerk shall read the bill or resolution into the record. A bill or joint resolution that is filed with the Chief Clerk of the House while the House stands in recess, in adjournment, or is not otherwise meeting, shall be given a number and entered upon a docket kept for that purpose. (2) Most simple and concurrent resolutions will be numbered and read into the record on the legislative day they are introduced and acted upon by the House. If the Speaker determines that a simple or concurrent resolution is of a nature that it should be assigned to a committee or other special circumstances apply, the resolution will be read and entered in the record under the process described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. (d) Introduction of a bill or resolution shall be considered the first reading of that bill or resolution, unless otherwise ordered by the House. The bill or resolution shall be read by title only, or by reference to the prefile list, and then be assigned by the Speaker to its appropriate committee.

A member who has a personal or private interest in any measure or bill pending before the House shall disclose the fact and shall not participate in the debate nor vote thereon; provided, however, that (i) upon the request of any other member of the House, a member who has such a personal or private interest may nevertheless respond to questions concerning any such measure or bill, or (ii) a member who has a personal or private interest may add factual matter to the debate which the member believes will correct wrong or false information.

Disclosure may be made by written statement submitted to the Chairperson of a committee or the Speaker of the House and read in open session in the committee or the House as the case may be. If the member is absent when a measure or bill is voted on which would have required disclosure required under paragraph a. then the member shall make the required disclosure as soon as possible upon returning to the committee or House. d. For the purposes of this Rule: 1. A "close relative" means a personâs parents, spouse, children (natural or adopted) and siblings of the whole and half-blood. 2. A "private enterprise" means any activity, whether conducted for profit or not for profit, and includes the ownership of real or personal property; provided that "private enterprise" does not include any activity of the State of Delaware, any political subdivision or any agency, authority or instrumentality thereof. 3. A person has a "financial interest" in a private enterprise if the person (i) has a legal or equitable ownership interest in the enterprise with a fair market value in excess of $5,000, or owns more than 10% of the enterprise if not traded on an established securities market, or owns more than 1% in the case of an enterprise whose securities are regularly traded on an established securities market, (ii) is associated with the enterprise and received from the enterprise during the last calendar year or might reasonably be expected to receive from the enterprise during the current or the next calendar year income in excess of $5,000 for services as an employee, officer, director, trustee, or independent contractor, or (iii) is a creditor of an insolvent private enterprise in an amount in excess of $5,000. 4.

No such complaint shall be considered by the House prior to its consideration and recommendation by the Ethics Committee. (d) If the Ethics Committee recommends some disciplinary action with respect to a complaint, it shall present a resolution to the House requesting that the House conduct a proceeding to consider the matter. If the Ethics Committee votes to dismiss a complaint, and there are no votes against dismissal in the Committee, the House shall take no action with respect thereto. If the Ethics Committee votes to dismiss a complaint, but there are dissenting votes in the Committee, the House may consider the matter upon the motion of any member of the House, approved by a majority vote of the House. In any proceeding before the House involving an alleged violation of a Rule of Legislative Conduct, the accused member shall be given an opportunity to be heard after notice, to be advised and assisted by legal counsel, to produce witnesses, and offer evidence and to cross-examine any witnesses. A transcript of any such proceeding shall be made and retained, and rules of procedure for ethics violations as may be adopted by the House shall apply. (e) If the House finds by a majority vote that a member has violated a Rule of Legislative Conduct, it may impose such disciplinary action as it deems appropriate, provided that no member may be suspended or expelled without the vote of two-thirds of the members of the House concurring therein.

BILLS, RESOLUTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES. RULE 19 - RESOLUTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES; DEFINITIONS . (a) The following types of resolutions may be considered by this body: (1) Simple Resolutions: A Simple Resolution is an expression of a majority of members on a specific subject, and deals with the internal affairs of the House only. The effect of its passage does not go beyond the bounds and the authority of the House. (2) Concurrent Resolutions: A Concurrent Resolution is used to accomplish the same purpose in relation to the entire General Assembly that the Simple Resolution achieves for either the House or Senate singly. It must be passed by both the House and Senate to become effective. A Concurrent Resolution adopted by the General Assembly does not become a statute, nor does it have the force and effect of law, nor can it be used for any purpose which requires the exercise of legislative power. (3) Joint Resolutions: A Joint Resolution is the most formal type of resolution, and is addressed to matters which are not internal affairs of either the House individually, nor the internal affairs of the General Assembly as a whole. It is of no legal effect unless passed by both Houses and approved by the Governor. Although a Joint Resolution is not a law, it is employed to provide for temporary measures, and has the force of law while in effect for a wide variety of limited purposes. A Joint Resolution is effective only for the General Assembly in which it was passed and approved. The requirement of the Governorâs signature for Joint Resolutions stems from its original use in instances where it was expedient or necessary to express the joint will and action of the General Assembly and Governor combined. (b) Each member of the House may issue tributes and memoriams at any time during the memberâs term of office. Tributes and memoriams shall be sequentially numbered by the Chief Clerk and made a part of the House Journal. Each tribute or memoriam shall be signed by the Prime Sponsor, the Speaker and the Chief Clerk. The Speaker, or the Speakerâs designee, shall cause to be read into the permanent record of the House such tributes and memoriams as have been filed with the Chief Clerk. Tributes and memoriams shall not require a vote; however, at the time such items are officially read into the record, any member may comment on the tributes or memoriams. Tributes and memoriams issued when the House stands in recess or adjournment shall be administratively managed by the Chief Clerk, who shall cause such items to be made a part of the official proceedings of the House. (c) A measure, as used in these Rules, means a bill, resolution, amendment, motion, or other question before the House. RULE 20 - PREPARATION AND CUSTODY . (a) Each bill and resolution shall be introduced with as many backed copies as are deemed necessary by the Speaker. The original of the bill or resolution shall at all times remain in the custody of the Chief Clerk of the House or the Chair of the committee to which it has been assigned. A "duplicate" backed copy may go (on request) to the following: the Speaker, the Sponsor, and the Division of Legislative Services. Upon introduction of a bill or resolution a copy shall be delivered to every member. Copies shall also be delivered to the Division of Legislative Services. (b) No bill or joint resolution shall be introduced into the House unless it be "prefaced" by a brief statement of its purpose which shall be known as the title, and the bill or resolution shall also contain the text of such bill or resolution in full. Each bill or resolution shall have an appropriate enacting or resolving clause. If a bill by its terms requires an extraordinary majority for enactment, such vote requirement shall be announced by the Speaker prior to roll call, and such vote requirement should be plainly indicated on the bill. At the end of each bill or joint resolution introduced, the author shall include a brief synopsis of the intent of the bill or joint resolution. In the lower left hand corner of page one shall be the initials of the unit preparing the bill or resolution, the initials of the drafter, and the initials of the typist; and, if prepared by automatic equipment, the identification number. (c) If a bill or resolution provides for the appointment or selection of members to a committee, task force or similar entity, there shall be a brief synopsis of the need for the creation of the committee, task force or similar entity. A copy of such bill or resolution shall be delivered to each person who is to make an appointment or selection and delivered to any person designated in the bill or resolution to be a member of the committee, task force, or similar entity. Such bill or resolution shall contain the criteria for the selection of the Chairperson and members of the task force or similar entity. RULE 21 - INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS; FILING WITH CHIEF CLERK . (a) Each bill or resolution shall be numbered in order as introduced, beginning with HB 1 for House Bills, HR 1 for House Resolutions, HCR 1 for House Concurrent Resolutions and HJR 1 for House Joint Resolutions, and the original backer shall contain the signatures of all the Sponsors of the original bill. (b) Every bill or resolution shall be introduced by one of the following methods: (1) Filing it with the Chief Clerk of the House by noon prior to the opening of the session by either of the following procedures: a. The Sponsorâs written direction to the Chief Clerk; or b. Verbal approval from the Sponsor to the Chief Clerk (original bill must be signed by the Sponsor before start of session). (2) Introduction from the floor while the House is in session if permitted by the Speaker. (c) (1) At the beginning of the dayâs session following the filing of a bill or joint resolution with the Chief Clerk, the Chief Clerk shall read the bill or resolution into the record.

(2) Most simple and concurrent resolutions will be numbered and read into the record on the legislative day they are introduced and acted upon by the House. If the Speaker determines that a simple or concurrent resolution is of a nature that it should be assigned to a committee or other special circumstances apply, the resolution will be read and entered in the record under the process described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. (d) Introduction of a bill or resolution shall be considered the first reading of that bill or resolution, unless otherwise ordered by the House. The bill or resolution shall be read by title only, or by reference to the prefile list, and then be assigned by the Speaker to its appropriate committee. (e) Resolutions of condolence, congratulations, or other non-controversial subject matters may be considered as part of the Consent Calendar without being assigned to a committee, unless any member objects. A suspension of the Rules is required in order to consider any other type of resolution without referring it to a committee. (f) The Prime Sponsor of a bill or resolution is the member who has responsibility of the drafting and introduction of a bill or resolution. The Prime Sponsor of a bill or resolution is that House member listed first to the right of the word "SPONSOR:" on the upper right side of the first page of a bill or resolution. Other House and Senate members may be Co-prime Sponsors if listed after the Prime Sponsor and if joined by the word "and" or the symbol "&". A Co-Sponsor is any member of the House or Senate whose name is printed on the measure after the name of all Prime and Co-prime Sponsors. A House member who wishes to be added as a Co-Sponsor after a measure has been printed and released may become a Co-Sponsor by signing the backer of the measure. (g) The Floor Manager of a House bill or House resolution is the Prime Sponsor, unless the Speaker designates a co-prime or co-sponsor to be the Floor Manager with the consent of the Prime Sponsor. The House Prime Sponsor of a Senate bill or resolution shall be the Floor Manager of that measure, unless the House Prime Sponsor declines to serve. If the House Prime Sponsor declines to serve as Floor Manager or if there is no House Prime Sponsor, the Speaker shall designate a House member to be the Floor Manager of that measure. (h) In order to withdraw a Sponsorâs sponsorship of a bill or resolution, a Sponsor shall submit to the Chief Clerk a written notice for this purpose.
