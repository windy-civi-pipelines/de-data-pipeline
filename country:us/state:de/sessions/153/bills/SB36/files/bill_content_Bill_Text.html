        <span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">This Act requires dealers to offer car buyers the opportunity to purchase a contract cancellation option agreement. The contract cancellation option agreement must allow buyers to cancel a car purchase no less than 3 business days after the dealer delivers the car to the buyer. The cost of the contract cancellation option is based on the cash sale price of the car. A dealer may also charge a restocking fee, based on the cash sale price, if a consumer cancels the car purchase. But the cost of the contract cancellation option must be credited to any restocking fee. If a consumer chooses to buy a car at the end of a lease and then exercises a contract cancellation option, a dealer may charge to that consumer any amount that would have been due under the lease for excess mileage, unrepaired damage, and excess wear and tear. The dealer must keep any trade-in motor vehicles through the end of the cancellation period.</span>

The dealer must give a full refund, less the restocking fee, and must return any trade-in car. If the dealer mistakenly sells the trade-in car before the cancellation period ends and the buyer exercises the right to cancel, the dealer must also refund the fair market value of the car or the value listed in the contract, whichever is higher. </span>
