      "abstract": "This substitute for House Bill No. 128, like House Bill No. 128, does the following:\r\nThis Act provides that the Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance Program is the primary payor, and other paid leave benefits must be coordinated with this benefit according to the terms of the policy or procedure governing other benefits. This Act also allows disability insurance benefits to be offset by family and medical leave benefits paid to an employee pursuant to the terms of a disability insurance policy.\r\nThis Act addresses private plans, and clarifies that an employer that meets its obligations under Chapter 37 of Title 19 through a private plan does not need to provide claim documentation to the Department except if there is an appeal, complaint, audit, or specific inquiry from the Department. Private plan employers with fewer than 25 employees that voluntarily elect to provide coverage under the Chapter that is otherwise exempted due to the size of their companies will be subject to all of the provisions of the Chapter.\r\nThis Act establishes a Paid Leave Advisory Committee to review issues related to the implementation and administration of the Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance Program and to review proposed statutory and regulatory amendments to the program.\r\n\r\nThis substitute differs from House Bill No. 128 as follows:\r\nThis substitute does not change the calculation of an application year or change the 24-month benefit period to a 12-month benefit period.\r\nThis substitute adds provisions for child support garnishment of PFMLA benefits.\r\nThis substitute prohibits the practice of requiring employees to use unused accrued paid time off before accessing PFMLA benefits.\r\nThis substitute allows the Paid Leave Advisory Committee to begin meeting once the Delaware LaborFirst system is functional and the steering committee has been dissolved.\r\nThis substitute specifies that family and medical leave benefits cannot be assigned and are exempt from the claims of creditors.\r\nThis substitute sets forth procedures for executing upon judgments for amounts due under Chapter 37 of Title 19 or other titles subject to this chapter."
