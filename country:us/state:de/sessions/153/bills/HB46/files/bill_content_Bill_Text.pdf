SYNOPSIS
Like House Bill 46, this Act ensures that no physician or medically authorized person shall perform an abortion
upon a child under the age of 16 without having obtained parental consent, except in cases of medical emergency or if the
Family Court adjudicates that the minor is mature and well-informed enough to make the decision independently, or
obtaining parental consent is not in the best interest of the minor, such as in cases of abuse, neglect, or coercion.
This Act differs from House Bill 46 by removing additional references to the former notice requirement in Chapter
17, Subchapter VIII, of Title 24, and by clarifying that a legal guardian may grant the consent required by this Act.
