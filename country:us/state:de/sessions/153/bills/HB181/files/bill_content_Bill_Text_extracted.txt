(b) An employer who discharges or in any manner discriminates against an employee because that employee has made a complaint or has given information to the Department under this chapter, or because the employee has caused to be instituted or is about to cause to be instituted any proceedings under this chapter, or has testified or is about to testify in any proceedings is deemed in violation of this chapter and is subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 nor more than $5,000 for each violation.

For those employers who do not remit contribution collected from employees, as the Family and Medical Leave Insurance Program allows, this will be a violation considered wage theft under 19 Del. C Â§1102A(a)(3).
