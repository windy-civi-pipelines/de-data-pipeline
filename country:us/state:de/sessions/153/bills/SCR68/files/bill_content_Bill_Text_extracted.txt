WHEREAS, Alfred IrÃ©nÃ©e duPont was born on May 12, 1864, in a stone house near the banks of the Brandywine River in Delaware, later marrying Jessie Ball, the sister of financier, Edward Ball; and WHEREAS, through his last will and testament, Alfred I. duPont, industrialist, scientist, musician, inventor, and philanthropist, established a Trust which provided for the formation of The Nemours Foundation, named for the duPont familyâs beloved homeland in France; and WHEREAS, The Nemours Foundation created the Alfred I. duPont Institute in Wilmington, Delaware, a facility dedicated to the care and treatment of children; and WHEREAS, Nemours Childrenâs Health has grown from a pediatric orthopedic hospital adjacent to Nemours Estate to one of the largest integrated pediatric health systems in the country. Everything Nemours does â medical care, research, education, prevention, and advocacy efforts â is focused on kids; and WHEREAS, Nemours Childrenâs Health offers care thatâs recognized for excellence. Nemours is ranked among the best in the nation, year after year, for the highest in quality and safety by the U.S. News and World Report; and WHEREAS, in 2024, Nemours supported over 1 million scheduled appointments, 750,000 medical visits, 39,789 telehealth visits and performed over 15,000 surgeries at its 35 locations and within its 11 collaborating Delaware Valley hospitals; and WHEREAS, 4,607 full-time associates, including 582 medical doctors, 1,200 registered nurses, and 226 advanced practice providers are all invested in going above and beyond to prevent and treat disabling childhood conditions; and WHEREAS, Nemours is actively researching the next innovations in care. Nemours is ranked 14th for National Institutes of Health research funding, out of 150 freestanding childrenâs hospitals in the United States. Nemours is one of 8 institutions in the nation contributing to PEDSnet, a large database that improves pediatric research and evidence-based care; and WHEREAS, Nemours continues its commitment to Delaware with its historic capital investments including the newly opened Lisa Dean Moseley Foundation Institute for Cancer and Blood Disorders, and the expansion of its Advanced Delivery Unit for high-risk newborns and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit; and WHEREAS, Nemours is on a continuous quest for innovation. As a champion of children, they are changing and leading the way America cares for its children. Rather than using old pay-for-sickness models of care, they are transitioning to pay-for-health approaches, aiming to prevent children from having health problems altogether; and WHEREAS, Nemours has adopted a whole child health model that promotes childrenâs optimal health, development, and well-being across the life course while improving health equity through delivery and payment reforms; and WHEREAS, Nemours Childrenâs Health and Delaware agreed to a groundbreaking whole child health payment model centered on the 120,000 children covered by Delawareâs Medicaid Program; and WHEREAS, whole child health models engage child health providers, payers, community-based organizations, and other multisector partners in improving population health and addressing social needs and broader social determinants of health affecting children, youth, and their families. NOW, THEREFORE: BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the 153rd General Assembly of the State of Delaware, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that May 12, 2025, is hereby recognized as Nemours Founders Day in the State of Delaware in honor of Alfred I. duPont and further recognize Nemours Childrenâs Health as one of the nationâs best and largest multistate pediatric healthcare systems.
