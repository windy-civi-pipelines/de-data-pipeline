(2) New tax rates approved by a school district under this Act must be reported to the County and delivered with a new warrant not later than 10 business days from the effective date of this Act. (3) Upon receipt of a new warrant under paragraph (2) of this Act, New Castle County shall supplement any tax bill already issued to taxpayers in that district for the 2025-2026 tax year and adjust initial billing using the new local school tax rates set by the district. New Castle County shall extend the deadline for payment of property tax bills for the 2025-2026 tax year that are supplemented or adjusted under this Act to October 30, 2025. (4) If a taxpayer submits payment prior to an adjustment in billing under paragraph (3) of this Act, and the taxpayerâs school tax bill is adjusted downward, New Castle County shall credit the overpayment against future school tax liability, unless a taxpayer submits a written request for refund of overpayment to New Castle County, in which case New Castle County shall issue a refund.

Upon receipt of a new tax warrant, New Castle County will supplement any tax bill already issued for taxpayers in that district and adjust tax bills with an extended deadline for payment of October 30, 2025 for tax bills that change. For any taxpayer who submits payment under the original tax bill and whose total school tax liability is adjusted downward, the difference will be credited against future tax liability unless the taxpayer submits a written request for a refund, in which case New Castle County shall issue a refund. A school district that resets its rates in accordance with this Act may request and borrow from State Division I funds in the event of a cash flow shortfall of local school funds due to the extension of the deadline for tax payments for the 2026 fiscal year.
