(4) âLease-purchase agreementâ means an agreement for the use of personal property by a natural person primarily for personal, family or household purposes, for an initial period of 4 months or less that is automatically renewable with each payment after the initial period, but does not obligate or require the lessee to continue leasing or using the property beyond the initial period, and that permits the lessee to become the owner of the property.

Â§ 7606. Advertising.

(2) The total amount of the lease payments necessary to acquire ownership; and ownership. (3) That the lessee will not own the property until the total amount necessary to acquire ownership is paid in full or by prepayment as provided for by law. (c)Â Item price disclosures . â Â Every item of lease-purchase property displayed or offered under a lease-purchase agreement shall have clearly and conspicuously indicated in Arabic numerals, so as to be readable and understandable by visual inspection, each of the following affixed to the item: (1) The cash price of the item; and item. (2) The amount of the lease payment and the total amount of the lease payments necessary to acquire ownership. (d) Nonapplication. â Â This section does not apply to the owner or personnel, as such, of any medium in which an advertisement appears or through which it is disseminated. (e) Information on online displays or offers. â For any lease-purchase property displayed or offered online and for which a consumer can enter into a lease-purchase agreement online or remotely through electronic commerce, a lessor may satisfy the requirements of subsection (c) of this section by electronic disclosure, clearly and conspicuously indicated in Arabic numerals that are readable and understandable by visual inspection, provided that this information is disclosed to the lessee before any of the disclosures required in Â§ 7603 of this title. (f) Information on displays or offers of third-party inventory. â When personal property that is not lease-purchase property is offered for lease-purchase by a lessor, a lessor shall provide the information described in subsection (c) of this section by electronic disclosure, clearly and conspicuously indicated in Arabic numerals that are readable and understandable by visual inspection, provided that this information is disclosed to the lessee before any of the disclosures required in Â§ 7603 of this title. SYNOPSIS This Act amends Title 6 by adding "lease-purchase property" to the Delaware Lease-Purchase Agreement Act. Pursuant to the Act, "lease-purchase property" means personal property that is owned by the lessor at the time it is displayed and offered for lease-purchase to the consumer. The Act provides that, for lease-purchase property offered online and available for online sale or sale by e-commerce, a lessor may satisfy the lessor's disclosure obligations under Â§ 7606(c) by electronic disclosure. Similarly, for personal property, other than lease-purchase property, that is offered for lease-purchase by a lessor, the lessor must disclose electronically the cash price of the item and the amount of the lease payment and the total amount of lease payments necessary to acquire ownership. These disclosures must be made before any of the disclosures required by Â§ 7603 of the Delaware Lease-Purchase Agreement Act. Finally, the Act makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual. Author: Senator Mantzavinos
