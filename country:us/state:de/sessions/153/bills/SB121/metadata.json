      "abstract": "This Act makes amendments to the Charter of the Town of Dewey Beach. Section 1 strikes language regarding budget requirements and process in Section 8(c) of the charter in favor of language that is currently included in Section 22 of the charter, concerning the Town Budget. \r\n\r\nSection 2 of the Act provides that the Town Manager is responsible for parking administration, in addition to the other enumerated responsibilities of the Town Manager under the current charter. \r\n\r\nSection 3 of the Act provides that the Town Manager, with the concurrence of the Audit Committee, may terminate the contract of an independent audit firm's contract to perform audit services for the Town.\r\n\r\nSection 4 of the Act provides that any candidate for Chief of Police who is not certified by the Delaware Council on Police Training must complete the necessary training for certification within 1 year of the date of employment, as a condition of employment. \r\n\r\nSection 5 of the Act provides that the Beach Patrol Captain is required to serve under a contract of no more than 3 years. \r\n\r\nSection 6 of the Act strikes redundant language regarding the town's power to borrow money, in favor of language currently included in Section 26 of the charter, concerning Borrowing Money and Issuing Bonds. \r\n\r\nSection 7 of the Act amends Section 26 of the charter to provide that bonds or other forms of certificates of indebtedness issued by the Town are exempt from all state, county, or municipal taxes and that the Town's indebtedness, in the aggregate, may not exceed $3 million at any one time."
