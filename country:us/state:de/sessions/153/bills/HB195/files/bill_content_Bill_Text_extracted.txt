Currently, Delaware is in the minority of states when it comes to requiring bartenders to be 21 years old. By reducing the legal bartending age to 18, this Act will help Delawareâs food service industry remain competitive with the many other states, including New Jersey and Pennsylvania, in which 18â20-year-olds can bartend.
