(2) The address of the self-service storage facility and the number, if any, of the space where the personal property is located and the name of the occupant. (3) The time, place and manner of the sale or other disposition. The sale or other disposition shall take place not sooner than 30 days after the first publication. (4) The name of each occupant whose property is to be sold. When a sale involves the property of more than 1 occupant, a single advertisement may be used to advertise the disposal of the property. (e) Any sale or other disposition of the personal property shall be held at the self-service storage facility or at the nearest suitable place to where the personal property is held or stored. A public sale includes offering the property on a publically publicly accessible website that regularly conducts online auction auctions or sales of personal property. Such sale shall be considered incidental to the self-storage business and no license shall be required. (f) Notwithstanding any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, if the property upon which the lien is claimed is a motor vehicle, trailer, or watercraft and the rent and other charges are the occupant is in default for 60 consecutive days, the owner may have the property towed. If a motor vehicle, trailer, or watercraft is towed as authorized in this section, the owner shall send, by verified or electronic mail to the occupantâs last known address, the name, address, and telephone number of the towing company that will perform the towing and the street address of the storage facility where the towed property can be redeemed; provided, however, if an owner sends the information to the occupantâs last known electronic mail address and does not receive an electronic receipt that establishes delivery of the notice to the occupantâs electronic mail address, the owner will deliver the information via verified mail to the occupantâs last-known address. (m) Prohibited use. (1) An occupant may not use a self-service storage facility after the owner or occupant has delivered written notice in person, by electronic mail, or by verified mail of the termination or non-renewal of the rental agreement. (2) The notice must provide the occupant with not less than 14 days after delivery of the notice to remove all personal property from the self-service storage facility. (3) Prior to the occupantâs removal of all personal property, the owner may place reasonable restrictions on the occupantâs use of the self-service storage facility, including denying access to the self-service storage facility except for the occupant to remove personal property during the ownerâs normal business hours. (4) The owner may dispose of any personal property remaining at the self-service storage facility after the date provided in the written notice under this section. SYNOPSIS This Act updates and modernizes the Delaware Self-Service Storage Facilities Act. The Act clarifies that self-storage rental agreements may be delivered and accepted electronically. The bill borrows language from the Delaware Residential Landlord Tenant Act regarding the legal effect of unsigned rental agreements. The bill addresses vehicle storage at a self-service storage facility and clarifies the disposition of property following the termination or nonrenewal of the rental agreement by either the occupant or owner. Finally, the Act updates the requirements to allow advertisements be placed on websites that regularly advertise property for auction or sale, making Delaware law consistent with most jurisdictions, including Maryland and the District of Columbia.
