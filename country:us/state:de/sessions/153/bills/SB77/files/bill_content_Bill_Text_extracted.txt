Such service shall constitute legal and valid service of process on the manufacturer. The manufacturer shall provide the name, address, telephone number, and proof of the appointment and availability of such agent to the Department. (2) The manufacturer shall provide notice to the Department 30 calendar days prior to termination of the authority of an agent and shall further provide proof to the satisfaction of the Department of the appointment of a new agent no less than 5 calendar days prior to the termination of an existing agent appointment. In the event an agent terminates an agency appointment, the manufacturer shall notify the Department of the termination within 5 calendar days and shall include proof to the satisfaction of the Department of the appointment of a new agent. (3) Any manufacturer whose electronic smoking devices or nicotine vapor products are sold in this state who has not appointed and engaged the services of an agent as required by this section shall be deemed to have appointed the Secretary of State as its agent for service of process. The appointment of the Secretary of State as agent shall not satisfy the condition precedent required in subsection (a) of this subsection to be included or retained in the directory. (l) Bond requirement for nonresident or foreign manufacturers. (1) Any nonresident or foreign manufacturer that has not registered to do business in the state as a foreign corporation or business entity shall, as a condition precedent to having its name or its electronic smoking devices or nicotine vapor products listed and retained in the directory submit to the Department a surety bond or other cash security satisfactory to the Department payable to the State of Delaware in the amount of $25,000. The bond shall be posted by a corporate surety located within the United States. (2) The bond shall be conditioned on the performance by the manufacturer of all requirements and obligations imposed by this section. A surety on a manufacturer's bond shall be liable up to the amount of the bond, and the State may execute on such surety bond for the payment of fines and penalties imposed on the manufacturer under this section and for the costs of seizure and destruction of products sold in violation of this section. If the State executes on the surety bond, it may require the manufacturer to provide an additional bond as a condition precedent for retaining the manufacturer or its products in the directory. (3) A surety on a bond furnished by a manufacturer as provided in this section shall be released and discharged from liability to the State accruing on the bond after expiration of 60 days from the date upon which such surety shall have lodged with the Department a written request to be released and discharged. This provision shall not operate to relieve, release, or discharge the surety from liability already accrued or which shall accrue before the expiration of the 60-day period. The Department shall, upon receiving any such request, notify the manufacturer who furnished the bond. Unless the manufacturer, on or before the expiration of the 60-day period, files with the Department a new bond, with the surety approved by and acceptable to the Department, the Department shall remove the manufacturer and its electronic smoking devices or nicotine vapor products from the directory. (m) Each wholesaler, distributor, or retailer that sells or distributes electronic smoking devices or nicotine vapor products in this state shall be subject to at least 2 unannounced compliance checks annually for purposes of enforcing this section. (n) Each retailer, distributor, and wholesaler that sells or distributes electronic nicotine delivery systems or nicotine liquids in this state shall be subject to at least 2 unannounced compliance checks annually for purposes of enforcing this section. Unannounced follow-up compliance checks of all noncompliant retailers, distributors, and wholesalers shall be conducted within 30 days after any violation of this section. The Department shall publish the results of all compliance checks at least annually and shall make the results available to the public on request. (o) The Department may promulgate rules necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. (p) All fees and penalties collected by the Department pursuant to this section shall be used for administration and enforcement of this section. (q) Starting January 31, 2026, and annually thereafter, the Department shall provide a report to the legislature regarding the status of the directory, manufacturers and products included in the directory, revenue and expenditures related to administration of this section, and enforcement activities undertaken pursuant to this section. (r) If any provision of this chapter or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this chapter are severable. SYNOPSIS This Act prohibits the sale of electronic smoking devices and nicotine vapor products that are not included in a directory of manufacturers and products eligible to be sold in the state. To be added to the directory, manufacturers of electronic smoking devices and nicotine vapor products must certify that they have complied with federal tobacco product premarket application requirements and pay annual fees.

In the event an agent terminates an agency appointment, the manufacturer shall notify the Department of the termination within 5 calendar days and shall include proof to the satisfaction of the Department of the appointment of a new agent. (3) Any manufacturer whose electronic smoking devices or nicotine vapor products are sold in this state who has not appointed and engaged the services of an agent as required by this section shall be deemed to have appointed the Secretary of State as its agent for service of process. The appointment of the Secretary of State as agent shall not satisfy the condition precedent required in subsection (a) of this subsection to be included or retained in the directory. (l) Bond requirement for nonresident or foreign manufacturers. (1) Any nonresident or foreign manufacturer that has not registered to do business in the state as a foreign corporation or business entity shall, as a condition precedent to having its name or its electronic smoking devices or nicotine vapor products listed and retained in the directory submit to the Department a surety bond or other cash security satisfactory to the Department payable to the State of Delaware in the amount of $25,000. The bond shall be posted by a corporate surety located within the United States. (2) The bond shall be conditioned on the performance by the manufacturer of all requirements and obligations imposed by this section. A surety on a manufacturer's bond shall be liable up to the amount of the bond, and the State may execute on such surety bond for the payment of fines and penalties imposed on the manufacturer under this section and for the costs of seizure and destruction of products sold in violation of this section. If the State executes on the surety bond, it may require the manufacturer to provide an additional bond as a condition precedent for retaining the manufacturer or its products in the directory. (3) A surety on a bond furnished by a manufacturer as provided in this section shall be released and discharged from liability to the State accruing on the bond after expiration of 60 days from the date upon which such surety shall have lodged with the Department a written request to be released and discharged. This provision shall not operate to relieve, release, or discharge the surety from liability already accrued or which shall accrue before the expiration of the 60-day period. The Department shall, upon receiving any such request, notify the manufacturer who furnished the bond. Unless the manufacturer, on or before the expiration of the 60-day period, files with the Department a new bond, with the surety approved by and acceptable to the Department, the Department shall remove the manufacturer and its electronic smoking devices or nicotine vapor products from the directory. (m) Each wholesaler, distributor, or retailer that sells or distributes electronic smoking devices or nicotine vapor products in this state shall be subject to at least 2 unannounced compliance checks annually for purposes of enforcing this section. (n) Each retailer, distributor, and wholesaler that sells or distributes electronic nicotine delivery systems or nicotine liquids in this state shall be subject to at least 2 unannounced compliance checks annually for purposes of enforcing this section. Unannounced follow-up compliance checks of all noncompliant retailers, distributors, and wholesalers shall be conducted within 30 days after any violation of this section. The Department shall publish the results of all compliance checks at least annually and shall make the results available to the public on request. (o) The Department may promulgate rules necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. (p) All fees and penalties collected by the Department pursuant to this section shall be used for administration and enforcement of this section. (q) Starting January 31, 2026, and annually thereafter, the Department shall provide a report to the legislature regarding the status of the directory, manufacturers and products included in the directory, revenue and expenditures related to administration of this section, and enforcement activities undertaken pursuant to this section. (r) If any provision of this chapter or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this chapter are severable.
