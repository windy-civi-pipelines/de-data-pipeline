Â SYNOPSIS Agriculture is currently the leading industry in Delaware but as housing and other development occurs less farmland becomes available. For farmers in general, but in particular the small and medium sized farm owners, the real estate taxes imposed on their farm structures imposes a significant financial impact and adversely affects their ability to survive. At least eighteen other states have recognized this problem and have through legislation provided real estate tax relief for qualified farm structures. This legislation would use the same mechanism for providing real estate tax relief for qualified farm structures as it currently exists for qualified farmlands. Author: Senator Hoffner
