SYNOPSIS An extension of the deadline for payment of property tax bills in New Castle County for the 2025-2026 tax year established under Chapter 135 of Volume 85 of the Laws of Delaware (House Bill No. 242, as amended by House Amendment 1, of the 153rd General Assembly) is required because property tax invoices could not be timely delivered due to subsequent, unforeseen expedited litigation before the Court of Chancery (Newark Property Association, et al. v. State of Delaware, et al., C.A. No. 2025-1031-LWW). The current deadline is November 30, 2025, however this Act changes the deadline to December 31, 2025, to ensure that taxpayers have a commercially reasonable period to review and pay property tax invoices and to help prevent the inequitable imposition of statutorily-mandated penalties and interest.
