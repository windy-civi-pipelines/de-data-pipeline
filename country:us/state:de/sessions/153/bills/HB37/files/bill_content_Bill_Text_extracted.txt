SYNOPSIS The Delaware Equal Accommodations Law, Chapter 45 of Title 6, prohibits discrimination in places of public accommodation on the basis of race, age, marital status, creed, religion, color, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin. This Act ensures that all government services, including those provided directly by government entities and those that are government-funded or supervised, are subject to the same non-discrimination requirements as private businesses by revising the definition of âplace of public accommodationâ. This Act also creates a definition of âpersonâ that is consistent with similar definitions in the Code. Sections 2 through 4 of this Act provide enactment instructions because House Bill No. 36 (153rd General Assembly) also revises Â§ 4502(19) of Title 6. This Act also makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual.
