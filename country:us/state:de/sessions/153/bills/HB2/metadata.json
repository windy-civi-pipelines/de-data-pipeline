      "abstract": "Section 1 of this Act increases the burial benefit under the State Employees' Pension Plan from $7,000 to $8,000. The amount of this benefit has not been increased since 2001 (See 73 Del. Laws, c. 146, \u00a7 5). \r\n\r\nSection 1 directly increases the amount of the burial benefit for individuals receiving a pension under the State Employees\u2019 Pension Plan, \u00a7 5546 of Title 29, and also increases the funeral benefits under additional pension plans because the amount of the benefits under the following pension plans is the same as the amount under \u00a7 5546 of Title 29:\r\n\u2022\tThe State Police Pension Plan, Chapter 83 of Title 11.\r\n\u2022\tThe Delaware County and Municipal Police and Firefighter Pension Plan, Chapter 88 of Title 11.\r\n\u2022\tThe early retirement option for state employees, Chapter 53 of Title 29.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Section 1 increases the reasonable funeral expenses permitted in a wrongful death action under \u00a7 3724(d)(4) of Title 10 because the maximum for these damages is the amount under \u00a7 5546 of Title 29.\r\n\r\nSection 2 of this Act increases the funeral expenses paid for a deceased member of a volunteer fire company, volunteer fire company ladies auxiliary, or volunteer ambulance and rescue company from $7,000 to $8,000. The amount of this benefit has not been increased since 2004 (See 74 Del. Laws, c. 339, \u00a7 1). \r\n\r\nConsistent with a legal interpretation of the existing law by state agencies, this Act continues to enable the payment of funeral expenses for the funeral of a deceased member of a volunteer fire company, volunteer fire company ladies auxiliary, or volunteer ambulance and rescue company even if the member was also a state employee entitled to burial benefits under \u00a7 8331 of Title 11, \u00a7 8395 of Title 11, \u00a7 8846 of Title 11, \u00a7 5316 of Title 29, or \u00a7 5546 of Title 29. However, this Act makes changes to existing law to make this legal interpretation clear and to specifically identify the state employee burial benefits to which this provision applies. \r\n\r\nThis Act takes effect on October 1, 2025, to provide time to implement this Act after the enactment of the fiscal year 2026 appropriations act containing the funding for this Act. \r\n\r\nThis Act also makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual."
