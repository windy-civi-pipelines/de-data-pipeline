(d) If any person is found to have violated Â§ 2599 of this subchapter, and said violation is committed against an elder person or a person with a disability, in addition to any civil penalty imposed, the court may impose and additional civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each violation. Â§ 2599B. Definitions. As used in this subchapter, unless the context otherwise requires: (1) âCompensationâ means payment of any money, thing of value, or financial benefit. (2) âElder personâ means a person who is 65 years of age or older. (3) âPersonâ Â means an individual, corporation, government, or governmental subdivision or agency, statutory trust, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, unincorporated association, 2 or more of any of the foregoing having a joint or common interest, or any other legal or commercial entity.

Section 2. This Act takes effect 18 months after its enactment into law. SYNOPSIS This act regulates persons who receive compensation for advising or assisting with veterans' benefits earned by serving our nation in the military. This bill would not prohibit persons or business entities from receiving compensation for advice to Veterans that is unrelated to veteran claims or services available to veterans from the V.A. or its accredited agencies. Investment, insurance, banking, and other advice or services not provided by the V.A., or its accredited agencies may be obtained by veterans and fees charged for such services.
