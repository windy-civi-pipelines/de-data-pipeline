This cost is defined as the additional incremental expense incurred by the provider that is in addition to the normal expense of billing and collecting the charges for the provision of the providerâs normal telephone service. Where moneys collected by the provider are equal to or less than the total charge for the telephone service provided to subscribers or customers by that provider, not including the surcharge, all moneys collected will be applied to the charges for the actual telephone service provided.

However, nothing in this chapter may be construed to prevent the State or the Agency from taking appropriate actions to collect the surcharge designated by a provider as uncollectable.

The consumer gives a Delaware address during the consummation of the retail transaction, including the customerâs payment instrument if no other address is available, and the address is not given in bad faith. e. The consumerâs mobile telephone number is associated with a Delaware location. (3) The surcharge is the liability of the consumer and not of the seller or of any prepaid wireless provider, except that the seller shall remit all surcharges that the seller collects from consumers as provided in this section, including all surcharges that the seller is deemed to collect where the amount of the surcharge has not been separately stated on an invoice, receipt, or other similar document provided to the consumer by the seller. (4) The amount of the surcharge that is collected by a seller from a consumer, if the amount is separately stated on an invoice, receipt, or other similar document provided to the consumer by the seller, must not be included in the base for measuring any tax, fee, surcharge, or other charge that is imposed by this State, any political subdivision of this State, or any intergovernmental agency. (5) If a minimal amount of prepaid wireless telecommunications service is sold with a prepaid wireless device for a single, nonitemized price, the seller may elect not to apply the surcharge imposed by this section to the retail transaction.
