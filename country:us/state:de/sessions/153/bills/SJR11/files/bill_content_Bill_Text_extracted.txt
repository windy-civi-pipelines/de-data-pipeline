Legislation Document SPONSOR: Sen.Â Pinkney & Rep.Â Griffith Rep. Harris DELAWARE STATE SENATE 153rd GENERAL ASSEMBLY SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 11 ESTABLISHING THE DELAWARE JUVENILE JUSTICE EDUCATIONAL TRANSITIONS TASK FORCE TO STUDY AND MAKE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING RE-ENTRY INTO COMMUNITY-BASED SCHOOLS AFTER INCARCERATION. WHEREAS, 85% of all youth released from the Level V facility at Ferris School and the Level IV cottages located on the Ferris campus are rearrested within 18 months of release, according to the 2025 Juvenile Recidivism report from the Delaware Criminal Justice Councilâs Statistical Analysis Center; and WHEREAS, many of the youth incarcerated at the Ferris School and the Level IV cottages have committed criminal offenses that prohibit them from in-person attendance at the middle school or high school in which they were enrolled before their arrest; and WHEREAS, Regulation 611 of Title 14 of the Delaware Administrative Code prohibits youth who have committed many higher level violent offenses, sex offenses, drug offenses, and weapons offenses from attending alternative schools in the Consortium Discipline Alternative Program; and WHEREAS, as a result of being banned from both traditional secondary schools and alternative schools, many, if not most, juveniles released from detention either drop out of school or are educated through home-based instruction, lacking any of the support services offered in a school setting; and WHEREAS, empirical evidence indicates that a positive post-release educational environment reduces the likelihood that a youth will be rearrested post release.
