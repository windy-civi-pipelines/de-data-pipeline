The nonconforming use laws for each county, Â§ 2610, Â§ 4920, and Â§ 6920 of Title 9 all prohibit structural alterations if a building is a nonconforming use but Â§ 1335B(a)(1) requires that a conversion licensee continue to operate the location as a medical dispensing location. Thus, it is extremely likely that a compassion center with a conversion license for a retail marijuana store will need to make structural alterations to operate both as a medical dispensing location and as a retail marijuana store. â¢	Requires that a county must allow the minimum hours of operation for a retail marijuana store to be 9 a.m. until 9 p.m. on Mondays through Saturdays and noon until 8 p.m. on Sundays. â¢	In areas zoned for agricultural or industrial use, indoor, fully enclosed cultivation facilities may not be prohibited. â¢	In areas zoned for commercial or industrial use, retail marijuana stores may be prohibited from operating only within a Â½ mile of another retail marijuana store and within 500 feet of a place of worship, school, licensed child care, residential treatment facility, park, or library. The limits on county restrictions under this Act preempt and supersede all existing and future county ordinances or regulations regarding the operation of marijuana establishments. Section 2 makes corresponding changes to Â§ 1351 of Title 4 so that section applies only to municipalities. This Act also makes technical changes to use consistent language in subsections (a) and (b) of Â§ 1351 and Â§ 1351A. Under Â§ 1302(17) of Title 4, ââmarijuana establishmentââ means all 4 types of entities licensed under Chapter 13 of Title 4. Author: Senator Paradee
