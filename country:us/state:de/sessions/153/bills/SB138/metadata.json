      "abstract": "This Act makes changes to Chapter 103 of Title 16, pertaining to the Delaware Health Information Network (\u201cDHIN\u201d). \r\n\r\nSection 1 makes a technical correction.\r\n\r\nSection 2 updates the composition of DHIN\u2019s Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) to reflect recent practice with respect to Governor-appointed boards. It removes the concept of positions held for certain groups or industries and replaces it with a general obligation to appoint members broadly representative of DHIN\u2019s stakeholder groups and the general public, with an emphasis on individuals with particular expertise that will benefit DHIN and its public mission. It also reduces the size of the board from 19 to 13 members to align with the historical size of DHIN\u2019s Board and to implement current best practices with respect to Board size, and specifies that a member\u2019s term may end before 3 years if the member resigns or is removed. \r\n\r\nSections 3 and 4 are cleanup provisions that remove references to the rules and regulations of the Health Care Commission that previously governed DHIN\u2019s operations, but that have been replaced by DHIN\u2019s own rules and regulations. Section 3 also updates the statute to reflect DHIN\u2019s preferred nomenclature as it relates to data senders, data recipients, and other users of DHIN\u2019s service. Section 3 does not change DHIN\u2019s ability to charge fees for services. \r\n\r\nSection 5 removes a reference to the Delaware Center for Health Innovation, which is no longer operating, and replaces it with a reference to the State. Section 5 also defines \u201cTriple Aim\u201d.\r\n\r\nSection 6 removes a reference to Statement 6 of the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission Enforcement Policy as it relates to antitrust regulations on the exchange of price and cost information. Statement 6 was withdrawn by the Biden Administration in February 2023. The new language leaves open the possibility that additional guidance will be provided in the future and provides that any release of information will need to comply with the antitrust rules and regulations in effect at that time."
