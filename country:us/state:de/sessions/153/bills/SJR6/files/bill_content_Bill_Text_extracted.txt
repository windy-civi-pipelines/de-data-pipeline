Legislation Document SPONSOR: Sen.Â Pinkney & Rep.Â Griffith Sens. Lockman, Sokola; Reps. Heffernan, Morrison, Neal, Romer, RossÂ Levin, Snyder-Hall DELAWARE STATE SENATE 153rd GENERAL ASSEMBLY SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 6 DIRECTING THE DIVISION OF MEDICAID & MEDICAL ASSISTANCE TO EXPLORE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM INITIATIVES. WHEREAS, health care is critical for pregnant individuals and translates to better outcomes for their children; and WHEREAS, according to the 2023 Delaware Maternal & Child Death Review Commission annual report (2023 annual report), 33% of fetal infant mortality review cases involved instances in which the pregnant individual had late or no prenatal care; and WHEREAS, the 2023 annual report identified access to prenatal care as a priority recommendation to improve fetal and infant outcomes; and WHEREAS, the 2023 annual report also identified that fetal infant mortality review cases reflect a growing number of foreign-born individuals who are receiving care in Delaware; and WHEREAS, immigrant individuals have higher risks of stillbirth, perinatal mortality, and neonatal mortality when compared to native-origin individuals, according to a 2022 review published in the International Journal of Public Health; and WHEREAS, immigrant individuals who are undocumented are the least likely to obtain adequate prenatal care; and WHEREAS, for those for whom cost is a barrier to receiving prenatal care, health-care options may be limited because federal law restricts using federal dollars to provide Medicaid and Childrenâs Health Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage to individuals who are immigrants; and WHEREAS, Delaware adopted a State option to expand full Medicaid coverage to pregnant immigrant individuals who are lawfully residing in the United States and are otherwise eligible for Medicaid; and WHEREAS, for an individual who is an undocumented immigrant, the only Medicaid coverage available is for emergency services, and labor and delivery; and WHEREAS, a lack of prenatal care can result in danger to the health and safety of the pregnant individual, more costly and complicated deliveries, and long-term adverse outcomes for the infants; and WHEREAS, in addition to the health and safety concerns facing the patient and infant, lack of prenatal care creates a significant burden for obstetrical care providers because patients who have not received prenatal care can present with undiagnosed complications at delivery; and WHEREAS, states can choose to adopt the CHIP From-Conception-to-End-of-Pregnancy (FCEP) option, which allows a state to use federal funding to extend full health-care coverage to individuals who are pregnant, undocumented, and otherwise qualified for coverage; and WHEREAS, the CHIP FCEP coverage would allow individuals to obtain health-care services, including prenatal care, during the course of their pregnancy; and WHEREAS, states who implemented the CHIP FCEP coverage experienced increases in prenatal care utilization compared to states who do not provide coverage, according to a publication in the Maternal and Child Health Journal; and WHEREAS, postpartum care is also critical to the health and wellbeing of the parent and child; and WHEREAS, according to a Committee Opinion published by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), âthe weeks following birth are a critical period for a woman and her infant, setting the stage for long-term health and well-beingâ but can present âconsiderable challengesâ and therefore ongoing postpartum care should be provided; and WHEREAS, more than one half of pregnancy-related deaths occur after the birth of the infant, according to data referenced in the ACOG Committee Opinion; and WHEREAS, for those individuals who are undocumented immigrants and for whom cost is barrier, access to postpartum services is limited, and is unavailable through Medicaid; and WHEREAS, other states have filled this postpartum coverage gap using federal funds through the creation of a CHIP Health Services Initiative (HSI) to offer robust postpartum care to those who are otherwise ineligible on account of immigration status; and WHEREAS, prenatal and postpartum care are instrumental to ensuring a healthy parent and infant population in Delaware. NOW, THEREFORE: BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the 153rd General Assembly of the State of Delaware, with the approval of the Governor, that the Division of Medicaid & Medical Assistance (DMMA) is directed to explore adoption of the Childrenâs Health Insurance Program (CHIP) From-Conception-to-End-of-Pregnancy (FCEP) option created by 67 Federal Register 61956 (October 2, 2002) under 42 C.F.R. Â§ 457 et seq. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that DMMA is directed to explore creation of a CHIP Health Services Initiative (HSI) to expand postpartum coverage to individuals who are otherwise ineligible for Medicaid or CHIP due to their immigration status . BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that no later than January 1, 2026, DMMA shall submit a final report expressing its conclusions whether adopting the CHIP FCEP option is advisable and whether creating a CHIP HSI to expand postpartum coverage is advisable, including a summary of the analysis performed, any facts and findings relevant to its conclusions, and any projected costs of adopting and implementing these efforts, to the President Pro Tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, with copies to all members of the General Assembly, the Controller General, and the Director and the Librarian of the Division of Legislative Services. SYNOPSIS This Senate Joint Resolution directs the Division of Medicaid & Medical Assistance (DMMA) to explore amending our Delaware Medicaid State Plan to allow for the adoption of the Childrenâs Health Insurance Program (CHIP) From-Conception-to-End-of-Pregnancy (FCEP) option and the creation of a Health Services Initiative (HSI) that will allow our State to use federal funding to partially cover prenatal and postpartum care for individuals otherwise ineligible for free or low-cost health-care coverage due to immigration status. This Joint Resolution also requires DMMA to provide a report to the General Assembly as to its findings no later than January 1, 2026. Author: Senator Pinkney
