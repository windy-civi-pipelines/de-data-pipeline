10 Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Controller General for revisions to components of the
11 transportation formula no later than April 1 of each fiscal year.
12 (b) Public School Transportation funds are allocated in the amount of $180,406.2 $187,002.3 in
13 accordance with the transportation formula, as adopted by the State Board of Education on July 23, 1987, subject to
14 the following amendments and procedural modifications:
15 (1) The per gallon price used to calculate the fuel allowance shall be based on the state contract bid
16 price for fuel plus $0.07 per gallon for districts and plus $0.31 per gallon for contractors. For
17 districts and contractors north of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, the per gallon price shall be
18 based on delivery to a large-sized tank (5,000 or more gallons). In the case of contractors located
19 south of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, the per gallon price shall be based on delivery to a
20 small-sized tank (275 - 1,900 gallons). Upon determination by the Department of Education that a
21 contractor located north of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal and operating five or fewer buses
22 does not have existing storage capacity in the large tank range, the per gallon price shall be based
23 on the smaller tank size.
24 The initial fuel rates shall be based on the state contract bid price as of June 1 of the
25 preceding fiscal year. Funding adjustment will be made when the annual average price increases
26 or decreases by at least $0.05 per gallon. The first review will be based on the annual averages
27 through December 31 of each fiscal year and additional reviews will be conducted each month
28 thereafter until April 30. Timing and frequency of fuel adjustments shall be determined by the
29 Department of Education, in collaboration with the Public School Transportation Committee.
221
1 Reviews may also be conducted at any time upon the request of the Director of the Office of
2 Management and Budget and the Controller General. Propane school buses will receive the same
3 fuel allowances and be subject to the same adjustment as diesel school buses;
4 (2) For the current fiscal year, the allowable cost of a new unused bus that was purchased by a
5 contractor and put on contract and that was produced between January 1, 2024 2025 and
6 December 31, 2024 2025 (as noted on the school bus identification plate) shall begin its seven
7 year capital allowance schedule using the 2023 2024 state bid price for new school buses, minus 2
8 percent for salvage value, plus 11 percent to account for dealer charges and profits not reflected in
9 the state bid price due to the higher number of buses being purchased and the lag time between
10 ordering and delivery. Any bus produced on or after January 1, 2024 2025, must meet the current
11 federal emissions requirements in order to receive a capital allowance. Any bus produced and
12 placed in service after January 1, 2024 2025 shall be entitled to an allowance based on the 2024
13 2025 state bid price.
14 A used bus placed in service shall utilize the allowance schedule which would have been
15 allowed had the bus been placed in service when new based on its production date. The bus shall
16 receive the remaining years of capital allowance. The Department of Education shall continue to
17 utilize the procedures developed in Fiscal Year 1989 for determining the allowable cost for any
18 size bus that it did not bid in Fiscal Year 2024 2025. In addition to the procedure for establishing
19 the allowable cost of a new bus specified above, the Department of Education is requested to
20 structure its bids for buses in Fiscal Year 2025 2026 in such a manner that public school bus
21 contractors will be permitted to purchase buses from the successful lower bidder at the same price
22 as the State of Delaware. If a contractor elects to purchase a bus at the bid price, the lowest base
23 bid of an awarded contract minus 2 percent for salvage value will be the allowable cost in
24 subsequent reimbursements to the contractor;
25 (3) For the current fiscal year, the fixed cost allowance for district and contractor buses shall include
26 funding for the provision of emergency communication devices. The Department of Education is
27 authorized to bring school districts or private contractors operating school buses equipped with
28 cellular phone technology under a state negotiated cellular phone contract; and
222
1 (4) For district operated pupil transportation services, bus driver and driver aide salaries shall receive
2 an increase commensurate with the general salary increase enumerated in Section 8 of this Act in
3 years in which one is provided.
4 (c) Except as specified in this section, or for changes in the price of fuel, or for the adjustments of those
5 items changed by state or federal laws, the Department of Education shall not change the transportation formula
6 unless the change has been authorized by the General Assembly and an appropriation therefore has been made by
7 the General Assembly.
8 (d) The Department of Education shall calculate the formula amounts for each district as provided herein
9 but shall only provide 90 percent of such calculation to each school district. The contract formula amount is the
10 maximum funding that any public-school transportation contractor is eligible to receive through a combination of
11 state and local funds. Homeless transportation funding shall be provided to school districts and charter schools at 90
12 percent of the total cost for approved, eligible students. This excludes transportation for foster children.
13 (e) Of the appropriation allocated for public school districts, funding is allocated to purchase air
14 conditioned buses to transport special need students. The Department of Education is authorized to allow the
15 purchase of air-conditioned buses required to transport special education students that have a medical need for air
16 conditioning (specified by a physician).
17 (f) $4,366.6 is allocated to increase the minimum hourly rate for bus drivers.
18 (g) (f) It is the intent of the General Assembly that, to the maximum extent possible, any funds provided
19 through the school transportation formula to provide hourly rates for bus drivers, that these funds shall go directly
20 toward increasing the salaries of bus drivers and to address workforce shortage and retention issues.
21 (h) $515.0 is allocated to increase the insurance allowance and standardize said allowance across bus
22 capacity sizes, per the recommendations of the Public School Transportation Committee report, dated March 21,
23 2024.
24 (g) It is the intent of the General Assembly to make progress toward implementing the recommendation of
25 the Public School Transportation Working Group to address school bus operating cost factors not reflected in the
26 school transportation formula, which has been in existence since 1977. These factors include, but are not limited to,
27 environmental compliance requirements for school bus maintenance, maintenance costs of advanced technology on
28 school buses, and school bus driver training requirements.
223
1 Section 333. (a) All school districts shall be required to utilize Busology, a computerized routing system
2 for school bus transportation, provided by the Department of Education to create school bus routes. Schools are
3 encouraged to maximize the capabilities of this system to derive transportation efficiencies to contain increasing

7 Section 332. (a) The Public School Transportation Committee, consisting of representatives from the
8 Department of Education, the Office of the Controller General, the Office of Management and Budget and
9 representatives for bus contractors and school district transportation supervisors shall make recommendations to the
10 Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Controller General for revisions to components of the
11 transportation formula no later than April 1 of each fiscal year.
12 (b) Public School Transportation funds are allocated in the amount of $180,406.2 $187,002.3 in
13 accordance with the transportation formula, as adopted by the State Board of Education on July 23, 1987, subject to
14 the following amendments and procedural modifications:
15 (1) The per gallon price used to calculate the fuel allowance shall be based on the state contract bid
16 price for fuel plus $0.07 per gallon for districts and plus $0.31 per gallon for contractors. For
17 districts and contractors north of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, the per gallon price shall be
18 based on delivery to a large-sized tank (5,000 or more gallons). In the case of contractors located
19 south of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, the per gallon price shall be based on delivery to a
20 small-sized tank (275 - 1,900 gallons). Upon determination by the Department of Education that a
21 contractor located north of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal and operating five or fewer buses
22 does not have existing storage capacity in the large tank range, the per gallon price shall be based
23 on the smaller tank size.
24 The initial fuel rates shall be based on the state contract bid price as of June 1 of the
25 preceding fiscal year. Funding adjustment will be made when the annual average price increases
26 or decreases by at least $0.05 per gallon. The first review will be based on the annual averages
27 through December 31 of each fiscal year and additional reviews will be conducted each month
28 thereafter until April 30. Timing and frequency of fuel adjustments shall be determined by the
29 Department of Education, in collaboration with the Public School Transportation Committee.
221

1 Reviews may also be conducted at any time upon the request of the Director of the Office of
2 Management and Budget and the Controller General. Propane school buses will receive the same
3 fuel allowances and be subject to the same adjustment as diesel school buses;
4 (2) For the current fiscal year, the allowable cost of a new unused bus that was purchased by a
5 contractor and put on contract and that was produced between January 1, 2024 2025 and
6 December 31, 2024 2025 (as noted on the school bus identification plate) shall begin its seven
7 year capital allowance schedule using the 2023 2024 state bid price for new school buses, minus 2
8 percent for salvage value, plus 11 percent to account for dealer charges and profits not reflected in
9 the state bid price due to the higher number of buses being purchased and the lag time between
10 ordering and delivery. Any bus produced on or after January 1, 2024 2025, must meet the current
11 federal emissions requirements in order to receive a capital allowance. Any bus produced and
12 placed in service after January 1, 2024 2025 shall be entitled to an allowance based on the 2024
13 2025 state bid price.
14 A used bus placed in service shall utilize the allowance schedule which would have been
15 allowed had the bus been placed in service when new based on its production date. The bus shall
16 receive the remaining years of capital allowance. The Department of Education shall continue to
17 utilize the procedures developed in Fiscal Year 1989 for determining the allowable cost for any
18 size bus that it did not bid in Fiscal Year 2024 2025. In addition to the procedure for establishing
19 the allowable cost of a new bus specified above, the Department of Education is requested to
20 structure its bids for buses in Fiscal Year 2025 2026 in such a manner that public school bus
21 contractors will be permitted to purchase buses from the successful lower bidder at the same price
22 as the State of Delaware. If a contractor elects to purchase a bus at the bid price, the lowest base
23 bid of an awarded contract minus 2 percent for salvage value will be the allowable cost in
24 subsequent reimbursements to the contractor;
25 (3) For the current fiscal year, the fixed cost allowance for district and contractor buses shall include
26 funding for the provision of emergency communication devices. The Department of Education is
27 authorized to bring school districts or private contractors operating school buses equipped with
28 cellular phone technology under a state negotiated cellular phone contract; and
222

1 (4) For district operated pupil transportation services, bus driver and driver aide salaries shall receive
2 an increase commensurate with the general salary increase enumerated in Section 8 of this Act in
3 years in which one is provided.
4 (c) Except as specified in this section, or for changes in the price of fuel, or for the adjustments of those
5 items changed by state or federal laws, the Department of Education shall not change the transportation formula
6 unless the change has been authorized by the General Assembly and an appropriation therefore has been made by
7 the General Assembly.
8 (d) The Department of Education shall calculate the formula amounts for each district as provided herein
9 but shall only provide 90 percent of such calculation to each school district. The contract formula amount is the
10 maximum funding that any public-school transportation contractor is eligible to receive through a combination of
11 state and local funds. Homeless transportation funding shall be provided to school districts and charter schools at 90
12 percent of the total cost for approved, eligible students. This excludes transportation for foster children.
13 (e) Of the appropriation allocated for public school districts, funding is allocated to purchase air
14 conditioned buses to transport special need students. The Department of Education is authorized to allow the
15 purchase of air-conditioned buses required to transport special education students that have a medical need for air
16 conditioning (specified by a physician).
17 (f) $4,366.6 is allocated to increase the minimum hourly rate for bus drivers.
18 (g) (f) It is the intent of the General Assembly that, to the maximum extent possible, any funds provided
19 through the school transportation formula to provide hourly rates for bus drivers, that these funds shall go directly
20 toward increasing the salaries of bus drivers and to address workforce shortage and retention issues.
21 (h) $515.0 is allocated to increase the insurance allowance and standardize said allowance across bus
22 capacity sizes, per the recommendations of the Public School Transportation Committee report, dated March 21,
23 2024.
24 (g) It is the intent of the General Assembly to make progress toward implementing the recommendation of
25 the Public School Transportation Working Group to address school bus operating cost factors not reflected in the
26 school transportation formula, which has been in existence since 1977. These factors include, but are not limited to,
27 environmental compliance requirements for school bus maintenance, maintenance costs of advanced technology on
28 school buses, and school bus driver training requirements.
223

1 Section 333. (a) All school districts shall be required to utilize Busology, a computerized routing system
2 for school bus transportation, provided by the Department of Education to create school bus routes. Schools are
3 encouraged to maximize the capabilities of this system to derive transportation efficiencies to contain increasing
4 costs.
