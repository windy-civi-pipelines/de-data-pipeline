Legislation Document SPONSOR: Rep.Â Morrison & Sen.Â Sturgeon Reps. Griffith, Phillips, RossÂ Levin, Snyder-Hall, S.Â Moore, Bush, Harris; Sen. Cruce HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 153rd GENERAL ASSEMBLY HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 47 RECOGNIZING RISING HIV INFECTION RATES, FEDERAL FUNDING CUTS, AND GROWING HEALTH DISPARITIES IN DELAWARE. WHEREAS, Delaware has experienced a 26% increase in new HIV diagnoses since 2020, reflecting a continuing and alarming upward trend in infections; and WHEREAS, federal HIV prevention funding for Delaware has been drastically reducedâfrom $1,539,000 in Fiscal Year 2023 to $490,000 in Fiscal Year 2024âa nearly 70% decrease, including the elimination of funding from the CDCâs Division of HIV Prevention; and WHEREAS, Delaware has historically depended on federal resources to support essential HIV prevention efforts such as free HIV testing, Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) navigation, harm reduction programs, and community outreach; and WHEREAS, Black and Hispanic Delawareans, LGBTQ+ individuals, and residents in rural areas are disproportionately affected by these funding cuts, exacerbating existing health disparities and limiting access to life-saving prevention services; and WHEREAS, untreated and undiagnosed HIV increases transmission, worsens health outcomes, and places a greater financial and operational burden on Delawareâs already strained healthcare system; and WHEREAS, the Governorâs Transition Report identifies preventative services and early intervention as key strategies to address social determinants of health, lower healthcare costs, reduce hospital reliance, and improve population health outcomes; and WHEREAS, community-based prevention services are essential to reaching high-risk and underserved populations, and their erosion due to funding cuts threatens to reverse progress in HIV prevention across the state. NOW, THEREFORE: BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the 153rd General Assembly of the State of Delaware, the Senate concurring therein, that the General Assembly acknowledges the growing risk of increasing HIV infection rates in the state. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the State should encourage community-based prevention services, expanded HIV testing, PrEP access, harm reduction strategies, and culturally responsive outreach programs to mitigate health disparities and reduce the burden on Delawareâs healthcare system. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the General Assembly encourages healthcare providers, advocacy organizations, and community leaders to collaborate in exploring avenues to reduce HIV infections and ensuring equitable access to preventative care statewide. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that copies of this Resolution be delivered to the Governor of the State of Delaware, the Lieutenant Governor, and the Secretary of the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services. SYNOPSIS This Concurrent Resolution recognizes the escalating HIV crisis in Delaware and the drastic reduction in federal HIV prevention funding. The Resolution encourages healthcare providers, advocacy organizations, and community leaders to collaborate in exploring avenues to reduce HIV infections and ensuring equitable access to preventative care statewide.
