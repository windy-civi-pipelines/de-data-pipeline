(b) (c) Justices of the peace shall have jurisdiction of any violation of this chapter. Section 4. Amend Chapter 69, Title 16 of the Delaware Code by making deletions as shown by strike through and insertions as shown by underline as follows: Â§ 6907. Advertising; required information. (a) No advertising for the sale of fireworks or products containing any pyrotechnic mixture may be distributed, published, aired, or otherwise made available to consumers in this State unless the advertising contains a warning that the use of fireworks is generally illegal without a permit in Delaware, that sparklers, poppers, and similar products may be illegal in Delaware, and that potential purchasers should check their local and state law before purchasing or using the advertised products. (b) Any retailer, manufacturer, or other person advertising fireworks or products containing any pyrotechnic mixture in this State who fails to make the required warnings in the advertising materials under subsection (a) of this section is subject to a civil fine of $1,000 for each violation.

(c) No sale of fireworks or products containing any pyrotechnic mixture in this State may be made unless the purchaser is provided with a written notice containing the following information, or such other information as the State Fire Prevention Commission may require by regulation, on letter-sized paper in large, bold font: (1) The products purchased by the consumer may be illegal in Delaware, and illegal possession or use may result in financial penalties. (2) Fireworks and similar products are dangerous, and improper use may result in death or serious physical injury. Â§ 6908. Wholesale license.

All money derived from permit fees, license fees, and civil penalties under this chapter shall be placed in a special fund to be used by the Office of the State Fire Marshall for enforcement and public education. SYNOPSIS Delaware's current fireworks laws have led to confusion among consumers and noncompliance, with individuals frequently using fireworks outside of legally permitted days. Many consumers are unaware they are breaking the law, while those who knowingly violate it face fines too low to serve as a deterrent. This results in ongoing nuisances for neighbors, increased risks of bodily harm, and heightened dangers of fires and property damage. Additionally, out-of-state retailers advertise illegal fireworks in Delaware without consequence, further misleading consumers. The absence of a registration process for fireworks retailers limits the State Fire Marshalâs ability to oversee the sale and distribution of these potentially hazardous products. This bill strengthens enforcement by increasing fines, regulating sales through a permit system, ensuring consumer awareness through required safety information, and generating revenue for the Fire Marshalâs office to improve oversight and public education. This Act requires a greater than majority vote for passage because Â§ 11 of Article VIII of the Delaware Constitution requires the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the members elected to each house of the General Assembly to impose or levy a tax or license fee.
