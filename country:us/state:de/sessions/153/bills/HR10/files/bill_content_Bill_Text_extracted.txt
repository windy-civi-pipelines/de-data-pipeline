Section 1:
Legislation Document SPONSOR: Rep.Â S.Â Moore Rep. Bush HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 153rd GENERAL ASSEMBLY HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 10 ENCOURAGING THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO INVEST IN MIDDLE SCHOOL YOUTH PROGRAMS. WHEREAS, according to Kids Count 2016, 21% of children are living in poverty in Delaware and only 38% of children are proficient in math by grade 5 and 49% of children are proficient in reading by grade 8; and WHEREAS, Section 1 of HB 200 of the 147 th General Assembly appropriated funds to the Department of Services for Children Youth and Their Families Prevention and Behavioral Health Services Prevention/Early Intervention for the purpose of providing statewide after-school programs focused on youth violence and child suicide prevention; and WHEREAS, the Secretary of the Department of Services for Children Youth and Their Families supported by the Criminal Justice Council was authorized to work with the Department of Education to determine allocation of said funding; and WHEREAS, in 2021, funding for middle school afterschool programs in Delaware was reallocated to prioritize investments in another age group initiative; and WHEREAS, a staggering 11.3 million students nationwide will be unsupervised today after the school bell rings. 28,000 of those students live in Delaware - thatâs almost 20% of students in Delaware. A total of 48,000 students would be likely to participate in an afterschool program if one was available; and WHEREAS, study after study has shown that afterschool programs help our students succeed. Students in afterschool programs are more likely to come to school, stay in school and to graduate. Participation in high-quality afterschool programs is linked to significant gains in standardized tests scores and work habits as well as reductions in behavior problems among disadvantaged students; and WHEREAS, afterschool programs are a lifeline for our working parents - on average they have 7 fewer unscheduled absences when they know their children are safe in an afterschool program; and WHEREAS, at best, these students are missing opportunities to be engaged and energized. At worst, they are exposed to a host of undesirable activities. Crime committed by and against juveniles spikes during the hours after school; and WHEREAS, students that donât participate in afterschool programs are 3 times more likely to be truant, use drugs, or use alcohol and 37% more likely to become teen parents; and WHEREAS, afterschool programs save money in the long run. Every dollar invested in afterschool programs saves at least $9 in reducing crime and welfare costs, improving studentsâ school performance and increasing learning potential; and WHEREAS, traditional childcare mirrors the Childcare Development Block Grant under which childcare subsidies (Purchase of Care) expire upon a childâs 13 th Â birthday; and WHEREAS, children aged 13 and above are most at risk as a result of lack of access to afterschool programs. NOW THEREFORE: BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the 153rd General Assembly of the State of Delaware, that the 153rd General Assembly commits to investing in out of school and summer services and programs for youth as they age out of traditional childcare and before they are able to enter the workforce. SYNOPSIS This House Resolution emphasizes the importance of middle school years and the need for additional investment in programs that serve middle school youth.
