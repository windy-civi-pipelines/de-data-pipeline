Respiratory care includes inhalation therapy and respiratory therapy. (2) âRespiratory care practitionerâ or âRCPâ means an individual who practices respiratory care in accord with the requirements of this subchapter; subchapter. (b) A respiratory care practitioner works under the general supervision of a person certified to practice medicine, whether by direct observation and monitoring, by protocols approved by a person certified to practice medicine, or by orders written or verbally given by a person certified to practice medicine. A respiratory care practitioner may evaluate patients and make decisions within parameters defined by a person certified to practice medicine and by the Board of Medical Licensure and Discipline. The work performed by a respiratory care practitioner includes, but is not limited to: includes: (1) Collecting samples of blood, secretions, gases, and body fluids for respiratory evaluations; evaluations. (2) Measuring cardiorespiratory volumes, flows, and pressures; pressures. (3) Administering pharmacological agents, aerosols, and medical gases via the respiratory route; route. (4) Inserting and maintaining airways, natural or artificial, for the flow of respiratory gases; gases. (5) Controlling the environment and ventilatory support systems such as hyperbaric chambers and ventilators; ventilators. (6) Resuscitating individuals with cardiorespiratory failure; failure. (7) Maintaining bronchopulmonary hygiene; hygiene. (8) Researching and developing protocols in respiratory disorders; disorders. (9) Performing pulmonary function studies; and studies. (10) The use of telemedicine as defined in this chapter and, as further described in regulation, the use of and participation in telehealth. (11) All forms of extracorporeal life support, including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R). SYNOPSIS This Act updates the Respiratory Care Advisory Council to the Board of Medical Licensure and Disciplineâs enabling act to allow qualified licensed respiratory therapists to perform all duties associated with extracorporeal life support. Under the current law, respiratory therapists are authorized to assist with such support but may not administer medication during the process. As a result, a therapist is required to wait for another licensed professional to do so, resulting in delays to patient care. This bill eliminates this delay in patient care and allows qualified respiratory therapists to work within the full scope of their training. This Act also makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual. Author: Senator Poore
