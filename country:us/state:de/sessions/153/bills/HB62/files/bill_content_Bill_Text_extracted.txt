Requires the utility to make at least 1 attempt to contact the occupant of a dwelling unit by telephone, text message, or email prior to termination of services for nonpayment during the cooling season. 8. Requires that the 14 days written notice include information about payment plans, government assistance programs, and other ways termination of services may be deferred. 9. Imposes a civil penalty of up to $1,000 in lieu of a misdemeanor. This Act also expands the scope of utility termination laws to include the termination of utilities run by municipal electric companies. Municipalities that use municipal electric companies will be responsible for adopting ordinances to enforce utility termination laws within the municipality. Among other things, House Substitute No. 1 for House Bill No. 62 differs from House Bill No. 62 by including additional times when shutoff of utilities is prohibited; removing the provision prohibiting shutoffs for occupants receiving certain benefits; and clarifying certain notice requirements.
