In Delaware, the cost of diabetes care has exceeded $1.1 billion each year for the past 3 years. This cost is unsustainable. According to research, the lifetime excess medical spending for people with diabetes can be substantial. For example, if diagnosed at age 40, the additional lifetime medical spending is estimated to be $125,000 - $211,000. However, reversing Type 2 diabetes could lead to significant savings. A recent study suggests if just 47.7% of cases of Type 2 diabetes nationwide were reversed, the savings in subsequent years could total roughly $137 billion annually, and </span>

New costly lifelong medicines are now being marketed and prescribed to fight the effects of diabetes in children as well as adults, with costs starting at $800 per month and higher; the minimum cost for these classes of medicines alone is $9,600 per patient per year. These medications, while costly, may also have significant side effects such as muscle wasting that can cause complications such as fracture risks in the elderly, especially females, brain fog, inflammation of the pancreas, and other complications indicating these medications are not a panacea. The healthcare expenses for prediabetes and diabetes patients averages 2.3 â 3 times higher than for a person without diabetes/prediabetes; and according to a CDC study last reviewed in 2024, type 2 diabetes diagnosed at the age of 50 shortened life expectancy by an average of 5â6 years. According to a University of Eastern Finland study of 1.5 million patients, diabetes diagnosed at the age of 40, reduced potential life years by about 10 years, and diabetes acquired in the 30âs meant an average reduction in life expectancy of approximately 13â14 years. The comparison was based on the overall life expectancy by age group calculated for both the EU and US populations.

The Pilot Program will establish baseline health data for each participant through physician-led laboratory testing. Comparative laboratory studies will be completed at regular intervals to monitor progress and compare values. Additionally, utilizing a technology that will in real time measure and monitor blood glucose while tracking other diabetes related metrics embedded within the technology will provide the most up to date individually specific health monitoring tailored to each participant, in effect creating personalized medicine.</span>

Dietary counseling by specially trained dieticians and diabetic care coordinators will enable the patients to be closely monitored and counseled for lifestyle changes such as reducing highly processed foods, and offer real time advice and mitigation strategies as provided by computer driven app in conjunction with continuous glucose monitoring or other advanced technologies as indicated when blood glucose numbers are spiking. </span>
