      "abstract": "On February 18, 2025, the City of Harrington passed Resolution 25-R-02 to seek support from the General Assembly to amend the City Charter. This Act amends the City of Harrington Charter, as requested by the City Council, by doing all of the following:\r\n\r\n1. Removing limitations on the number of terms that an individual may serve as Mayor or a member of the City Council.\r\n2. Removing the requirement that City funds be placed in a bank located in the City and allow the funds to be placed in bank approved by the City Council. \r\n3. Changing the annual budget deadline from May 1 to June 1.\r\n4. Changing the deadline for the auditor of accounts to submit an audit report from within 120 days from the end of the fiscal year to within 150 days from the end of the fiscal year. \r\n5. Removing the Clerk of Council from the succession of authority for Mayor. \r\n6. Allowing an approved member of the City Council to sign checks in the Mayor\u2019s absence.\r\n\r\nThis Act also makes additional requested changes, not included in Resolution 25-R-02, by doing all of the following: \r\n1. Moving the deadline to determine the City\u2019s revenue needs from May 1 to June 1 to match the updated budget deadline.\r\n2. Removing the City Treasurer\u2019s authority to approve and countersign checks or warrants for paying bills or other claims against the City, so that the checks or warrants must be approved and signed by the City Manager and the Mayor, or a Council member designated by the Mayor. \r\n\r\nThis Act also makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual, including adding language to clarify that the Vice Mayor is elected from among the City Council members instead of appointed.\r\n\r\nThis Act requires a greater than majority vote for passage because \u00a7 1 of Article IX of the Delaware Constitution requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members elected to each house of the General Assembly to amend a municipal charter."
