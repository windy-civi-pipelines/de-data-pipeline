An individual subject to debarment may be employed by a business which engages in home improvement, provided that the individual does not engage in solicitation of work for the business. (2) (3) âHome improvementâ means any alteration, repair, addition, modification or improvement to any dwelling or the property on which it is situated, including but not limited to the construction, painting or coating, installation, replacement or repair of driveways, sidewalks, swimming pools, unattached structures, porches, kitchens, bathrooms, chimneys, fireplaces, stoves, air conditioning or heating systems, hot water heaters, water treatment systems, electrical wiring or systems, plumbing fixtures or systems, doors or windows, roofs, gutters, downspouts and siding. (3) (4) A âhome improvement contractâ is any agreement, whether written or oral, whereby a person offers or agrees to provide home improvements in exchange for payment in any form, regardless of whether any such payments have been made, and includes all agreements for labor, services, and materials to be furnished and performed under the contract.

(6) A âqualifying convictionâ means a conviction for theft, home improvement fraud, or new home construction fraud or any comparable offense under the laws of any other state, the United States, or any territory of the United States, that arose from any of the following: a. Operating a business engaged in home improvement. b. Soliciting for a business engaged in home improvement. c. Employing individuals to engage in home improvement. d. Having an ownership interest in a business engaged in home improvement. (d) (1) Except where the person who purchased the home improvement is 62 years of age or older, or an âadult who is impairedâ as defined in Â§ 3902 of Title 31, or a âperson with a disabilityâ as defined in Â§ 3901(a)(2) of Title 12, home improvement fraud is a class A misdemeanor, unless the loss to the person who purchased the home improvement is $1500 or more, in which case it is a class G felony. Any individual with 2 or more qualifying convictions, at least 1 of which was entered after [the effective date of this Act], is subject to debarment. For purposes of debarment, a second or later qualifying conviction must not arise from the same incident or series of incidents which led to the first qualifying conviction. (2) Where the person who purchased the home improvement is 62 years of age or older, or an âadult who is impairedâ as defined in Â§ 3902 of Title 31, or a âperson with a disabilityâ as defined in Â§ 3901(a)(2) of Title 12, home improvement fraud is a class G felony, unless the loss to the person who purchased the home improvement is $1500 or more, in which case it is a class F felony.

(4) Any individual who is subject to debarment under this statute but nevertheless engages in the activity prohibited pursuant to the debarment is subject to a Class D felony regardless of whether home improvement fraud has occurred on existing construction projects. SYNOPSIS This Act protects consumers by regulating home improvement contracts. Among other things, this Act provides the buyer with a right to cancel home improvement contracts within 3 days (5 days for those over the age of 62 or with a disability); limits contract deposits and material deposits; and time periods in which construction must begin. It also prohibits confessions of judgments and hasty debt transfers. If a party to a home improvement contract violates a provision of this new subchapter, a person who is damaged as a result has a cause of action to seek damages, costs, and reasonable attorney's fees. This Act also creates a requirement that individuals convicted of 2 or more offenses of home improvement fraud after the effective date of this Act must be subject to debarment. This debarment will preclude these individuals from operating a business which engages in home improvement services or from employing other individuals to engage in home improvement services. Debarred individuals may work for a company which engages in home improvement themselves, so long as they are not in control of the company in question. This bill also enhances penalties for home improvement fraud for those with prior convictions for home improvement fraud; and creates enhanced penalties for individuals who engage in home improvement services while operating companies which are not registered with the Delaware Department of Laborâs Contractor Registry.

Section 3. Amend Â§ 916, Title 11 of the Delaware Code by making deletions as shown by strike through and insertions as shown by underline as follows: Â§ 916.

(a) For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply: (1) âContract priceâ means the total price agreed upon under a home improvement contract. (2)a.âDebarmentâ means the prohibition of any home improvement contractor who has received 2 or more qualifying convictions, at least 1 of which was entered after [the effective date of this Act], from registering or retaining a certificate of registration as a contractor under the Delaware Contractor Registration Act under Chapter 36 of Title 19. b. An individual subject to debarment may be employed by a business which engages in home improvement, provided that the individual does not engage in solicitation of work for the business. (2) (3) âHome improvementâ means any alteration, repair, addition, modification or improvement to any dwelling or the property on which it is situated, including but not limited to the construction, painting or coating, installation, replacement or repair of driveways, sidewalks, swimming pools, unattached structures, porches, kitchens, bathrooms, chimneys, fireplaces, stoves, air conditioning or heating systems, hot water heaters, water treatment systems, electrical wiring or systems, plumbing fixtures or systems, doors or windows, roofs, gutters, downspouts and siding. (3) (4) A âhome improvement contractâ is any agreement, whether written or oral, whereby a person offers or agrees to provide home improvements in exchange for payment in any form, regardless of whether any such payments have been made, and includes all agreements for labor, services, and materials to be furnished and performed under the contract. (4) (5) A âmaterial factâ is a fact that a reasonable person would consider important when purchasing a home improvement of the variety being offered. (6) A âqualifying convictionâ means a conviction for theft, home improvement fraud, or new home construction fraud or any comparable offense under the laws of any other state, the United States, or any territory of the United States, that arose from any of the following: a. Operating a business engaged in home improvement. b. Soliciting for a business engaged in home improvement. c. Employing individuals to engage in home improvement. d. Having an ownership interest in a business engaged in home improvement. (d) (1) Except where the person who purchased the home improvement is 62 years of age or older, or an âadult who is impairedâ as defined in Â§ 3902 of Title 31, or a âperson with a disabilityâ as defined in Â§ 3901(a)(2) of Title 12, home improvement fraud is a class A misdemeanor, unless the loss to the person who purchased the home improvement is $1500 or more, in which case it is a class G felony. Any individual with 2 or more qualifying convictions, at least 1 of which was entered after [the effective date of this Act], is subject to debarment. For purposes of debarment, a second or later qualifying conviction must not arise from the same incident or series of incidents which led to the first qualifying conviction. (2) Where the person who purchased the home improvement is 62 years of age or older, or an âadult who is impairedâ as defined in Â§ 3902 of Title 31, or a âperson with a disabilityâ as defined in Â§ 3901(a)(2) of Title 12, home improvement fraud is a class G felony, unless the loss to the person who purchased the home improvement is $1500 or more, in which case it is a class F felony.

Where the loss to the person who purchased the home improvement is at least $100,000, home improvement fraud is a class B felony. (4) Any individual who is subject to debarment under this statute but nevertheless engages in the activity prohibited pursuant to the debarment is subject to a Class D felony regardless of whether home improvement fraud has occurred on existing construction projects. SYNOPSIS This Act protects consumers by regulating home improvement contracts. Among other things, this Act provides the buyer with a right to cancel home improvement contracts within 3 days (5 days for those over the age of 62 or with a disability); limits contract deposits and material deposits; and time periods in which construction must begin. It also prohibits confessions of judgments and hasty debt transfers. If a party to a home improvement contract violates a provision of this new subchapter, a person who is damaged as a result has a cause of action to seek damages, costs, and reasonable attorney's fees. This Act also creates a requirement that individuals convicted of 2 or more offenses of home improvement fraud after the effective date of this Act must be subject to debarment. This debarment will preclude these individuals from operating a business which engages in home improvement services or from employing other individuals to engage in home improvement services. Debarred individuals may work for a company which engages in home improvement themselves, so long as they are not in control of the company in question. This bill also enhances penalties for home improvement fraud for those with prior convictions for home improvement fraud; and creates enhanced penalties for individuals who engage in home improvement services while operating companies which are not registered with the Delaware Department of Laborâs Contractor Registry.
