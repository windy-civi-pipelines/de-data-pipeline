      "abstract": "Beginning in 2002, schools, school districts, and licensed child care providers have been required to keep binders of community notifications with information about registered sex offenders. This requirement was enacted based on recommendation from the Community Notification Task Force that schools have a role in community awareness. However, this requirement has created financial, administrative, and emotional burdens for staff who maintain the binders. The binders are rarely reviewed by the public and they do not necessarily provide up-to-date information or information on sex offenders in the immediate geographic area of the school, school district, or licensed child care provider. Additionally, in its March 31, 2002, report, the Community Notification School Task Force found that schools do not have the expertise to answer inevitable questions regarding the nature of particular offenses or the risk posed by particular offenders, and that it is not an appropriate role for educators to answer those questions. \r\n\r\nThis Act eliminates the requirement that a school, school district, or licensed child care provider keep community notifications in a binder. Instead, schools, school district, or licensed child care providers are required to provide \u201cschool and child care notification\u201d that includes all of the following information: \r\n\r\n1. Notification that searchable records available to the public can be obtained at a police agency or the Delaware State Bureau of Identification (\u201cSBI\u201d). \r\n2. Notification that the public can register for community notifications on the Delaware Sex Offender Central Registry website. \r\n3. The URL for the Delaware Sex Offender Central Registry website. \r\n\r\nThe school, school district, or licensed child care provider must provide the school and child care notification upon request from staff, faculty, or a parent or guardian of an enrolled child. Additionally, the school, school district, or licensed child care provider must post the school and child care notification on its website or, if it does not have website, the school, school district, or licensed child care provider must send the information to staff, faculty, and a legal parent or guardian of an enrolled child in writing at least annually.\r\n\r\n The Act also clarifies that sex offender registry information must be available on the Internet on the Delaware Sex Offender Central Registry website.\r\n\r\nFederal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (\u201cSORNA\u201d) guidelines require law enforcement to keep a registry of sex offenders and to provide public notification. Specifically, the guidelines require law enforcement to notify schools, but do not require schools to provide access to sex offender records. Instead, federal law enacted in 2006, 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20920, requires states to provide public access to sex offender registry information on the Internet. \r\n\r\nThe SBI maintains the Delaware Sex Offender Central Registry on its website, which allows the general public to find information about registered sex offenders by searching the offender\u2019s information or by searching in a geographic radius. The website also allows the public to sign up for e-mail notifications regarding sex offenders who appear on the website. The website is updated every Friday. It is easily accessible to most of the public, including on computers at public libraries. \r\nAdditionally, the public can request sex offender registry information in-person at a Delaware State Police troop. The public also can call the SBI for information. Certain municipal police agencies, such as the City of Dover Police Department and the Newark Delaware Police Department, also provide access to community notifications for offenders located in the municipality on the agency\u2019s website. Law-enforcement agencies are better equipped than schools or licensed childcare providers to answer questions about the registry. \r\n\r\nThis Act also makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual."
