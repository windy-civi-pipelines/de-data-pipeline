WHEREAS, after World War II, the decolonization of the African continent gathered momentum as Africans increasingly agitated for more political rights and independence; and WHEREAS, with the exceptions of Ethiopia and Liberia, Europe had colonized every country in Africa; and WHEREAS, while in some parts of the continent colonial powers reluctantly and grudgingly relinquished power, in other places, African people launched protracted struggles against colonial regimes; and WHEREAS, between 1945 and 1965, a significant number of African countries gained independence from European colonial powers; and WHEREAS, on March 6, 1957, Ghana became the first African country south of the Sahara to gain independence; and WHEREAS, Ghanaâs independence served as an inspiration to other African countries struggling against colonial rule, and as a result, Ghana occupied a central role in the struggle against colonial rule; and WHEREAS, just over a year after its independence and under the leadership of Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana convened the first Conference of Independent African States (Conference) on April 15, 1958, bringing together various African countries, including Ghana, Ethiopia, Sudan, Liberia, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia, as well as representatives of the National Liberation Front of Algeria and the Union of Cameroonian Peoples; and WHEREAS, this Conference was the first pan-African conference to be held on the continent and was an unequivocal assertion of Africaâs rejection of colonial and imperialist domination of the continent, becoming a collective platform from which African countries sought to cooperate in the struggle against colonialism; and WHEREAS, to further encourage and forge a common goal of fighting against colonial rule, the Conference called for the annual observance of African Freedom Day, to mark âthe onward progress of the liberation movement, and to symbolize the determination of the People of Africa to free themselves from foreign domination and exploitation;â and WHEREAS, during this Conference, President Nkrumah presented his vision of the United States of Africa, but the majority of those in attendance were overwhelmingly against his idea because it risked dissolving sovereignty and territorial integrity; and WHEREAS, this disagreement led to the emergence of 3 ideological blocs on the continent: the Casablanca Group, comprised of 7 countries; the Monrovia Group, comprised of 12 countries; and the Brazzaville Group, comprised of 12 countries; and WHEREAS, these 3 ideological blocs were brought together when, on May 25, 1963, 32 heads of independent African states gathered in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to sign the founding charter for the Organization of African Unity (OAU); and WHEREAS, the OAU manifested the pan-African vision for an Africa that was united, free, and in control of its own destiny; and WHEREAS, the OAU identified the need to promote understanding among Africaâs peoples and foster cooperation among African states in a larger unity transcending ethnic and national differences; and WHEREAS, the date of the observance known as âAfrican Freedom Dayâ was changed to May 25 to coincide with the anniversary of the creation of the OAU and it was renamed, becoming âAfrica Dayâ or âAfrican Unity Day;â and WHEREAS, in July 2002 the OAU evolved into the African Union, reflecting a consensus by African leaders that to realize Africaâs potential, there was a need to refocus attention from the fight for decolonization and ridding the continent of apartheid, the focus of the OAU, towards increased cooperation and integration of African states to drive Africaâs growth and economic development; and WHEREAS, each year, on May 25, Africans around the globe celebrate Africa Day; and WHEREAS, Africa Day commemorates the founding of the first union of African countries on May 25, 1963, and is an opportunity to reflect on the progress made by the African Union in achieving its goals, especially in regard to protecting the human rights and freedoms of Africans; and WHEREAS, on May 25, 2025, the people of the State of Delaware join Delawareâs African residents, Africans, and people of African descent all over the world as they rededicate themselves to strengthening partnerships in pursuit of peace and sustainable progress for all Africans on Africa Day. NOW, THEREFORE: BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the 153rd General Assembly of the State of Delaware, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that May 25, 2025, is designated as âAfrica Dayâ in the State of Delaware.
