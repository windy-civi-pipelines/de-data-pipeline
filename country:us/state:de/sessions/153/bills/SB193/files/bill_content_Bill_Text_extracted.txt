(c) (1) For contracts executed after [the implementation date under 83 Del. Laws, c. 129, Â§â6], a contractor or subcontractor may satisfy the craft training requirement under this section by making a payment in the amount established under Â§ 204(b)(2)b.2. of Title 19, for the craft into the Apprenticeship and Training Fund of the Department Labor. (2) For each calendar year, a contractor or subcontractor satisfies the craft training requirement for all contracts executed during that year when payments made under paragraph (c)(1) of this section after January 1 equal the following amounts: a. For employers with 10 through 25 employees, payments that total $10,000.Â b. For employers with more than 25 employees, payments that total $20,000. (d) (1) All contracts that require a craft training program under subsection (a) of this section must contain a penalty provision against the successful bidder for the failure to comply with the requirements under this section.

(3) All money received from penalties under paragraph (d)(1)b. of this section, that is not remitted or refunded, reverts to the government entity under the contract for which the penalty was imposed. SYNOPSIS Apprenticeship and workplace-based training are âearn while you learnâ systems that offer young people the chance to learn from the best trained construction workers in Delaware. Skilled craft apprenticeship programs offer the necessary capacities, resources, and flexibility needed to help low-income, minority, and female workers achieve and retain construction careers, while simultaneously assisting local construction employers obtain the skilled workforce they need to help drive growth in their local labor markets. This bill removes the âbuy-outâ for contractors to avoid participating in apprentice programs by paying into the Apprenticeship and Training Fund created in 2021. This âbuy-outâ benefits bad actors or those businesses only coming into Delaware to work on state taxpayer-funded projects whereas most Delaware merit shops and 100 percent of union shops have apprentice and training programs. The âbuy outâ also incentivizes contractors or never create training because the maximum cost of the buy-out is less than the cost to operate, fund, or participate in an apprentice program.
