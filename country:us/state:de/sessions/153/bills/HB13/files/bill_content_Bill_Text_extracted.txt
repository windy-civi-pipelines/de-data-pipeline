Section 2. Amend Â§ 1161, Title 30, by making deletions as shown by strike through and insertions as shown by underline as follows: Â§ 1161. Persons required to make returns of income. An income tax return with respect to the tax imposed by this chapter shall be made by the following: (1) Every resident individual who individual, if any of the following apply: a. Is The individual is required to file a federal income tax return for the taxable year, or year. b. Is The individual is a single person and has for the taxable year adjusted gross income as modified by Â§ 1106 of this title of more than $9,378, or $9,387. c.

The result of the changes under this Act will be that those with a taxable income of $188,500 or less will see no increase in personal income taxes, with 94% of Delaware taxpayers receiving an overall tax decrease. Like HS 1 for HB 13, House Substitute No. 2 for HB 13 differs from HB 13 as follows: â¢ Creates additional tax brackets for taxable income not in excess of $60,000. â¢ Decreases the tax rate for all tax brackets for taxable income not in excess of $60,000. â¢ Creates 3 additional tax brackets for taxable income above $60,000 instead of 2. â¢ Names this Act the âThe John Kowalko, Jr., Fairness in Taxation Actâ. In addition, House Substitute No. 2 for HB 13 differs from HS 1 for HB 13 as follows: â¢ Further decreases the tax rate for all tax brackets for taxable income not in excess of $60,000. â¢ Revises the tax brackets so that tax rates increase for taxable income above $150,000 instead of $125,000. â¢ Adjusts the personal income tax filing threshold to align with the revised tax brackets. â¢ Makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual.
