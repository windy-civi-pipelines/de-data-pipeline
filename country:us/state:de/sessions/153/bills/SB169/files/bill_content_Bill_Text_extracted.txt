SYNOPSIS In December 2024, the Code Revisors provided the General Assembly with a list of potential technical corrections that they identified as they revised the Delaware Code to reflect legislation that was enacted by the 152nd General Assembly in 2024 or as they reviewed titles of the Code. While technical in nature, these changes are beyond the authority of the Code Revisors to make and can only be done by the General Assembly through legislation. This Act also includes technical corrections identified outside of the list provided by the Code Revisors. This Act requires a greater than majority vote for passage to err on the side of caution because some of the sections of the Delaware Code being revised may require a super-majority vote under the Delaware Constitution. This Act also makes also makes basic technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual. Section 1. This section corrects errors in Â§ 1202 of Title 3 from Senate Bill No. 191 from the 135th General Assembly by renumbering the defined terms to appear in correct alphabetical order and by making technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual style. Sections 2 through 12. These sections correct errors throughout Chapter 13 of Title 3 as enacted in Senate Bill No. 307 from the 138th General Assembly, and later amended, by making technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual style. Section 13. This section corrects grouping and phrasing errors in Â§ 2103(b) of Title 6 from Senate Bill No. 296 of the 152nd General Assembly. Section 14. This section inserts use of the Oxford comma and the word âorâ in Â§ 4504(b)(1) of Title 6 as both had been missing in Senate Bill No. 315 of the 138th General Assembly and in order to adhere to Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual style. Section 15. This section inserts use of the Oxford comma in Â§ 1405(b) of Title 9 to correct errors in House Bill No. 55 from the 143rd General Assembly in order to adhere to Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual style. Section 16. This section removes a reference to medical malpractice review panels in Â§ 566(b) of Title 10, as those panels were discontinued by Senate Bill No. 208 of the 152nd General Assembly. Sections 17 and 18. These sections correct errors by removing the stray phrase âor projectile weaponâ in the future contingent versions of Â§Â§ 2105(b)(3) and 2107(c) of Title 11. These errors were created when House Bill No. 357 of the 152nd General Assembly did not take into account changes contained in Senate Bill No. 12 of the 152nd General Assembly. Section 19. This section corrects an error in Â§ 1716E(h) of Title 14, from House Bill No. 100 of the 151st General Assembly, by inserting utilization of the Oxford comma. Section 20. This section substitutes âsubsectionâ for and erroneous reference to âparagraphâ in Â§ 3001(e)(4) of Title 14 as inserted by Senate Bill No. 305 of the 152nd General Assembly. Section 21. This section removes an unnecessary âet seq.â following a finite reference to âthe federal Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-134)â in Â§ 3004 of Title 14 as inserted by Senate Bill No. 305 of the 152nd General Assembly. Sections 22 through 24. These sections complete the substitution of âperinatalâ for âmaternalâ throughout Chapter 8D of Title 16, begun in Senate Substitute No. 1 of Senate Bill No. 106 of the 152nd General Assembly, in order to remove gender-specific language as directed by Â§ 211(c)(1) of Title 1 and the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual style. Sections 25 and 26. These sections substitute the indefinite âet seq.â for âthrough 1396w-7â in Â§ 1304(b) and (c)(1) and Â§ 1045(d)(2)f. and (e)(1) of Title 16 in order to acknowledge the need to comply with all of Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act which has grown since enactment of Senate Substitute No. 1 for Senate Bill No. 13 of the 152nd General Assembly which had created the more finite reference to what was then the final section of the title. Section 27. This section properly substitutes penalty amounts in Â§ 1109(e) of Title 16 which had been improperly substituted by Senate Bill No. 216 of the 152nd General Assembly without appropriate striking of present language and underlining of new insertions. Section 28. This section corrects an error in Â§ 2503B(c) of Title 16, from Senate Bill No. 309 from the 152nd General Assembly, by substituting âorâ for âandâ to make it clear that any of among a health-care institution, health-care professional, or certified peer recovery specialist may assist an individual with creating an advance mental health-care directive.

Section 30 through 34. These sections correct stylistic errors in Chapter 102 of Title 16, from House Bill No. 57 of the 144th General Assembly, by conforming all â2-1-1 Helplineâ references to accepted style without hyphenation as approved by the Federal Communications Commission and by making adjustments in line with proper Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual style. Section 35. This section corrects an error in Â§ 2379(g) of Title 19 by properly striking âanâ which was removed without appropriate striking in Senate Bill No. 306 of the 152nd General Assembly. Section 36. This section properly enacts the specific intent of Senate Bill No. 206 of the 152nd General Assembly by substituting âcold weather operationsâ for âwinter weather operationsâ in Â§ 4356A(b)(3) of Title 21. Section 37. This section corrects an error in Â§ 4402(d) of Title 21, created by House Bill No. 352 of the 152nd General Assembly, by properly inserting âcounty code enforcement or municipal policeâ using appropriate underlining of the new insertion. Section 38. This section corrects an error in the introductory paragraph of Â§ 5302 of Title 24, from House Bill No. 386 of the 152nd General Assembly, by making clear that the defined terms in the section apply to all of Chapter 53 of Title 24 and not just to Â§ 5302 of that title.

SYNOPSIS In December 2024, the Code Revisors provided the General Assembly with a list of potential technical corrections that they identified as they revised the Delaware Code to reflect legislation that was enacted by the 152nd General Assembly in 2024 or as they reviewed titles of the Code. While technical in nature, these changes are beyond the authority of the Code Revisors to make and can only be done by the General Assembly through legislation. This Act also includes technical corrections identified outside of the list provided by the Code Revisors. This Act requires a greater than majority vote for passage to err on the side of caution because some of the sections of the Delaware Code being revised may require a super-majority vote under the Delaware Constitution. This Act also makes also makes basic technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual. Section 1. This section corrects errors in Â§ 1202 of Title 3 from Senate Bill No. 191 from the 135th General Assembly by renumbering the defined terms to appear in correct alphabetical order and by making technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual style. Sections 2 through 12. These sections correct errors throughout Chapter 13 of Title 3 as enacted in Senate Bill No. 307 from the 138th General Assembly, and later amended, by making technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual style. Section 13. This section corrects grouping and phrasing errors in Â§ 2103(b) of Title 6 from Senate Bill No. 296 of the 152nd General Assembly. Section 14. This section inserts use of the Oxford comma and the word âorâ in Â§ 4504(b)(1) of Title 6 as both had been missing in Senate Bill No. 315 of the 138th General Assembly and in order to adhere to Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual style. Section 15. This section inserts use of the Oxford comma in Â§ 1405(b) of Title 9 to correct errors in House Bill No. 55 from the 143rd General Assembly in order to adhere to Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual style. Section 16. This section removes a reference to medical malpractice review panels in Â§ 566(b) of Title 10, as those panels were discontinued by Senate Bill No. 208 of the 152nd General Assembly. Sections 17 and 18. These sections correct errors by removing the stray phrase âor projectile weaponâ in the future contingent versions of Â§Â§ 2105(b)(3) and 2107(c) of Title 11.

Sections 25 and 26.

Section 36. This section properly enacts the specific intent of Senate Bill No. 206 of the 152nd General Assembly by substituting âcold weather operationsâ for âwinter weather operationsâ in Â§ 4356A(b)(3) of Title 21.
