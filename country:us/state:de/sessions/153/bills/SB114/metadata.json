      "abstract": "This Act requires a municipality to comply with all limitations and requirements contained in Chapter 95 of Title 29 and \u00a7 120 of Title 22 whenever the municipality uses eminent domain to acquire real property. This Act prohibits a municipality from using eminent domain to acquire real property for recreational use.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a municipality shall hold a public hearing before using eminent domain to acquire real property. A municipality shall give notice of the public hearing at least 10 days prior to the date of the public hearing by doing all of the following:\r\nPublishing an advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality or in the county in which the municipality is located.\r\nIf the owner can be identified, by mailing written notice by certified mail to the owner of the real property the municipality plans to acquire by eminent domain. \r\n\r\nThe required notice must include all of the following information:\r\nA description of the real property to be acquired.\r\nThe public use for which the real property is to be acquired.\r\nThe time and place for the public hearing.\r\n\r\nAt the public hearing, all of the following must be explained:\r\nThe public use for the real property is to be acquired.\r\nThe reason for choosing the real property for the public use.\r\nThe right of each owner of the real property to receive just compensation under Chapter 95 of Title 29.\r\nThe right of each owner of the real property to negotiate, including the right to accept or reject the offer of damages required under Chapter 95 of Title 29. \r\n \t\r\nPublic comment must be allowed at the public hearing and any objection raised at the public hearing must be considered. \r\n\r\nThis Act also updates the condemnation procedure in Chapter 61 of Title 10 to require a municipality bringing a condemnation action to show compliance with the public hearing requirement in \u00a7 120 of Title 22 in its complaint. \r\n\r\nThis Act applies to condemnation proceedings filed after the Act\u2019s enactment into law.\r\n\t\r\nThis Act also makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual. \r\n\r\nThis Act requires a greater than majority vote for passage because \u00a7 1 of Article IX of the Delaware Constitution requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members elected to each house of the General Assembly to amend a municipal charter, whether directly, by amendment to a specific municipality\u2019s charter, or, as in this Act, indirectly, by a general law."
