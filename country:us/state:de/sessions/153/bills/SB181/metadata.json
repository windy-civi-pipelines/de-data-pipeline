      "abstract": "This Act prohibits certain actions regarding the sale and exchange of tickets for events in this state by primary ticket sellers, ticket issuers, and ticket resellers. The Act requires a clear and conspicuous disclosure of fees and costs associated with the total cost of a ticket being provided to a purchaser before the purchaser\u2019s payment information is requested. The Act prohibits the reselling of a ticket until the event is placed on sale to the general public, including any tickets that may be obtained or accessed through a fan club. The Act sets forth requirements regarding transferability of tickets, refunding of tickets, and bans on the use of deceptive practices for any reselling of a ticket. \r\n\r\nThe Act prohibits use of a bot or other methods used to circumvent reasonable restrictions on the sale of tickets on the internet. The Act places a cap on prices in which a reseller can offer or sell a ticket at 10% of the total price of the initial ticket price. It also places a requirement upon any person who resells 100 or more tickets per year to register with the Division, excluding tickets that are bought for sporting events as part of a season ticket package. The Act requires registered resellers to provide certain identifying information and submit a report every two years summarizing the total tickets sold, the original purchase price of each ticket, and the final resale price. \r\n\r\nThe Act requires a surety bond requirement upon registered resellers to protect consumers in cases where the reseller fails to provide tickets. The Act provides authority for the Division to audit registered resellers, maintain a list of all registered resellers that is available to the public, and revoke a registration of a reseller for violation of this chapter. The Act establishes penalties and provides the Division with authority to adopt regulations. \r\n\r\nThe Act is effective immediately and is to be implemented the earlier of 1 year from the date of enactment or notice of publication within the Register of Regulations that final regulations have been promulgated."
