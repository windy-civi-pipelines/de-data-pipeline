Legislation Document SPONSOR: Sen.Â Cruce & Rep.Â K.Â Williams Sens. Sokola, Walsh, Hoffner, Pettyjohn, Huxtable DELAWARE STATE SENATE 153rd GENERAL ASSEMBLY SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 84 SUPPORTING THE STATE OF DELAWAREâS PARTICIPATION IN THE SOUTHERN REGIONAL EDUCATION BOARDâS CRISIS RECOVERY SUPPORT NETWORK. WHEREAS, after natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, following school shootings, and in public emergencies, recovery must be prioritized as a long-term process, rather than an immediate response only; and WHEREAS, states, districts, and postsecondary institutions have focused on crisis prevention and management, but may not have the capacity to provide sustained support for their students, teachers, communities, and even their own counselors during the recovery stage; and WHEREAS, rural districts and institutions in particular tend to have fewer counselors and limited access to additional counseling resources; and WHEREAS, school counselors are often expected to respond to student needs after tragedy, even as they themselves grapple with the emotional toll, underscoring the need for external support for the entire school community; and WHEREAS, schools and institutions affected by crisis may require at least a year of dedicated support to fully recover; and WHEREAS, recovery efforts can strain resources that are already stretched thin, given that a National Center for Education Statistics study showed that less than half of public schools surveyed believe that their school is able to provide mental health services to all students in need; and WHEREAS, recovery is an extended healing process for students and adults alike, and having additional counselors come to the aid of a school or institution in extreme need supports the healing process of all people in the community, including teachers and counselors at that school; and WHEREAS, specialized training for counselors is essential to ensure that they have psychological first aid training and provide counseling that aligns with the unique needs of an educational environment; and WHEREAS, research shows that students who receive adequate support after a crisis are more likely to succeed academically, remain in school, and contribute positively to society; and WHEREAS, the Southern Regional Education Board, with its 75-year history of partnering with states to improve education, is uniquely equipped to lead this effort because of its ability to mobilize key education and policymaking stakeholders at all levels. NOW, THEREFORE: BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the 153rd General Assembly of the State of Delaware, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that to meet the urgent need for a coordinated, region-wide effort to provide consistent long-term counseling capacity that is ready to deploy immediately after a crisis is managed, the General Assembly voices its support for the State of Delaware to participate in the Southern Regional Education Board Crisis Recovery Support Network. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the General Assembly encourages the Governor, the Department of Education, Delaware school districts, and postsecondary institutions to partner with the Southern Regional Education Board to support this initiative, which will complement existing school and district crisis management efforts by focusing on long-term healing and psychological resilience by deploying counselors with specialized training to schools in extreme need. SYNOPSIS This resolution encourages Delawareâs participation in the Southern Regional Education Boardâs Crisis Recovery Support Network. Author: Senator Cruce
