This Act takes effect 180 days after its enactment into law. SYNOPSIS This Act updates certain statutory fees in Title 7 and establishes or updates certain permit and licensing fees found in 68 Del. Laws Ch. 86 (1991). These are fees charged for regulatory activities within the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) divisions of Air Quality, Waste and Hazardous Substances, Water, and Watershed Stewardship, most of which have not changed or been updated since 1991. The intent of the increased and new fees is to bring revenue generated by fees more in line with the cost of the regulatory programs and activities they support, including the cost of employees who work in those areas. The effective date for the fee changes is 180 days after enactment. Fees that are assessed by application or activity will be seen by applicants or permit holders the next time they apply for or renew permits or licenses after the effective date. Those who apply for permits or renewals before the effective date will pay current fees. Fees that are assessed on an annual basis will be seen by applicants the first time they pay the fee after the effective date. Certain fees for municipalities will not take effect until July 1, 2026 and will be billed at 50% of the new rate in the first year. DNREC is required to keep a complete list of fees and assessment on its public website. This Act requires a greater than majority vote for passage because Â§ 10 of Article VIII of the Delaware Constitution requires the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the members elected to each house of the General Assembly to increase the effective rate of any tax levied or license fee imposed.

Laws Ch. 86 (1991). These are fees charged for regulatory activities within the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) divisions of Air Quality, Waste and Hazardous Substances, Water, and Watershed Stewardship, most of which have not changed or been updated since 1991. The intent of the increased and new fees is to bring revenue generated by fees more in line with the cost of the regulatory programs and activities they support, including the cost of employees who work in those areas. The effective date for the fee changes is 180 days after enactment. Fees that are assessed by application or activity will be seen by applicants or permit holders the next time they apply for or renew permits or licenses after the effective date. Those who apply for permits or renewals before the effective date will pay current fees. Fees that are assessed on an annual basis will be seen by applicants the first time they pay the fee after the effective date. Certain fees for municipalities will not take effect until July 1, 2026 and will be billed at 50% of the new rate in the first year. DNREC is required to keep a complete list of fees and assessment on its public website. This Act requires a greater than majority vote for passage because Â§ 10 of Article VIII of the Delaware Constitution requires the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the members elected to each house of the General Assembly to increase the effective rate of any tax levied or license fee imposed.
