      "abstract": "This Act makes several changes to the Delaware Nursing Home Residents Quality Assurance Commission (\"Commission\"): \r\n     - Modernizes the Commission name to the \"Delaware Residents\u2019 Protection Commission.\" The Joint Legislative Oversight and Sunset Committee, during its review of the Commission from 2020-2022, recommended the Commission change its name to something shorter that is easier to remember. \r\n     - Better delineates the Commission's duties. \r\n     - Adds provisions to streamline the Commission's operations, including removal of a member who consistently misses meetings and approving Commission action on the affirmative vote of a majority of members present at a meeting. \r\n     - Gives the Commission the authority to seek grants to support the Commission's operations. \r\n     - Allows for the establishment of subcommittees to more effectively and efficiently meet the needs of the Commission \r\n     - Clarifies the Commission\u2019s responsibility to advocate for residents of monitored facilities, work with other agencies and groups to promote systemic reform, and act as an informational resource for the public. \r\n     - Authorizes the Commission to hold a virtual meeting with a physical location open to the public if a Commission staff member is present at the anchor location. \r\n\r\nThis Act has an effective date of 90 days after the date of enactment into law, to provide the Commission with time to transition from the existing membership to the membership that this Act establishes. This Act also makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual. \r\n\r\nLike Senate Substitute No. 1 for Senate Bill No. 155, Senate Substitute No. 2 for Senate Bill No. 155 differs from Senate Bill No. 155 by doing the following: \r\n     - Changes the term \"long-term care facility\" to \"monitored facility.\" \r\n     - Removes language relating to Administrative Office of the Courts. \r\n     - Adds 2 members to the Commission: the President of LeadingAge New Jersey/Delaware and the Director of State Governor Affairs, Delaware, of the Alzheimer's Association, Delaware Valley Chapter. \r\n     - Makes a technical change to the provision relating to virtual meetings.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Senate Substitute No. 2 for Senate Bill No. 155 differs from Senate Bill No. 155 as follows:\r\n     - Maintains the Gubernatorial appointments as they exist in current law.\r\n     - Amends a Commission duty so that, under this Act, the Commission provides education and recommends policies aimed at improving the quality of care, quality of life, and safety of residents of monitored facilities."
