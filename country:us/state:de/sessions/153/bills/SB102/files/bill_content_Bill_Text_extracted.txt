Section 2. This Act shall be effective July 1, 2026. SYNOPSIS This Act would limit the opportunity to remain as a licensed apprentice electrician after an individual has already completed an apprentice program approved by the Board of Electrical Examiners. Apprenticeship is meant to be a first step on a career journey, not a destination. Since the apprentice electrician license was created, the ranks of apprentices have steadily swollen, but a significant number of those apprentices have not moved forward toward more advanced licensing. As the number of these apprentices grows beyond the capacity for more senior licensees to supervise their work, the situation is likely to create confusion among and to threaten the safety of consumers of electrical services in Delaware and the general public. This bill also makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual. Author: Senator Walsh
