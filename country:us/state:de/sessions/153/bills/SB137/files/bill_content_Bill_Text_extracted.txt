(2) Reimburse the consumer for the full amount of any overdraft or non-sufficient funds fees imposed on that consumer by the consumerâs depository institution, which are caused by the provider attempting to seek payment of any outstanding proceeds, fees, voluntary tips, gratuities, or other donations on a date before, or in an incorrect amount from, the date or amount disclosed to the consumer. However, this requirement shall not apply with respect to payments of outstanding proceeds, fees, tips, gratuities, or other donations incurred by a consumer through fraudulent means.

Such activities and practices include, but are not limited to, the use of tactics which mislead the consumer, misrepresent the consumer transaction or any part thereof or otherwise create false expectations on the part of the consumer. (b) The Commissioner may temporarily suspend any license pending the issuance of a final order as provided in Chapter 101 of Title 29. (c) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, no license shall be revoked or suspended except after notice and an opportunity for the licensee to request a hearing in accordance with Chapter 101 of Title 29. (d) Any licensee may surrender any license by delivering to the Commissioner such license together with written notice that it thereby surrenders such license, but such surrender shall not affect such licenseeâs civil or criminal liability for acts committed prior to such surrender. (e) No revocation, suspension or surrender of any license shall impair or affect the obligation of any preexisting lawful contract between the licensee and any person. (f) Every license issued hereunder shall remain in force and effect until the same shall have expired or shall have been surrendered, revoked or suspended in accordance with this chapter, but the Commissioner shall have authority to reinstate a suspended license or to issue a new license to a licensee whose license shall have been revoked if no fact or condition then exists which would have warranted the Commissioner in refusing originally to issue such license under this chapter.

(2) Prelicensing education and testing, and postlicensing continuing education of individuals employed by the applicants or licensees subject to the system.

(c) The administrator of any such system in which the Commissioner participates is authorized to act on behalf of the Commissioner to collect from the applicants and licensees subject to the system any payments due the Commissioner under this chapter, to collect information and maintain records in electronic or other format relating to those applicants and licensees, and to submit fingerprints and any other information required for a criminal history background check to the Federal Bureau of Investigation or other law-enforcement agency. (d) Information maintained on any such system in which the Commissioner participates regarding the applicants and licensees subject to the system may be shared with any other state participating in that system for the purpose of licensing, regulating, or supervising that same applicant or licensee under a statute similar to this chapter, if that state could have obtained that same information directly from the applicant or licensee under its own law. The Commissioner shall ensure that the system maintains appropriate confidentiality, privacy, data security, and security breach notification policies that are in full compliance with Delaware law. Â§ 2617. Applicability of other state financial services laws. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of state law to the contrary, any earned wage access services offered or provided by a licensee in accordance with this chapter shall not be considered: (1) A violation of or noncompliance with any law relating to the payment of minimum or overtime wage or governing the sale or assignment of, or an order for, earned but unpaid income. (2) A loan or other form of credit or debt, and the licensee shall not be considered a creditor, debt collector, or lender. (3) Money transmission, and the provider shall not be considered a money transmitter.

If there is a conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other state law, the provisions of this chapter control. SYNOPSIS Earned Wage Access (EWA) is a Fintech product that allows workers to voluntarily access the money they have already earned during a pay-period for work they have already completed, ahead of their scheduled payday. Users primarily access EWA services through a mobile app and are only able to withdraw wages their EWA provider has verified that they have already earned. This verification process, coupled with the fact that EWA transactions are non-recourse and credit-invisible make the product distinct from loans and credit cards. As an innovative financial product with distinct characteristics that do not fit within existing regulations, EWA requires a distinct regulatory framework. Currently, more than 100,000 workers in Delaware have already used Earned Wage Access services, which are mostly unregulated in the state. This bill helps ensure that responsible EWA providers can operate under the supervision of Delawareâs banking regulator and continue to serve users in the state of Delaware. Moreover, this bill codifies a regulatory framework that recognizes the distinct characteristics of EWA products and will keep Delawareans protected from bad actors who might seek to use the âEarned Wage Accessâ moniker, while instead offering a predatory product. Specifically, this bill protects consumers in Delaware by creating a new Earned Wage Access provider license, issued by the Office of the State Bank Commissioner to companies whose products meet the following criteria, ensuring that: â¢	All users have at least one reasonable no-cost option for each transaction â¢	All fees and gratuities are clearly and transparently represented to users before they confirm their transactions â¢	EWA transactions are credit-invisible, that providers do not check a userâs credit before issuing EWA services, nor do they report to a credit agency if a user cancels their service â¢	EWA providers do not pursue recourse against users including charging interest, late fees, or sending unresolved EWA transactions to collections Author: Senator Mantzavinos

SYNOPSIS Earned Wage Access (EWA) is a Fintech product that allows workers to voluntarily access the money they have already earned during a pay-period for work they have already completed, ahead of their scheduled payday. Users primarily access EWA services through a mobile app and are only able to withdraw wages their EWA provider has verified that they have already earned. This verification process, coupled with the fact that EWA transactions are non-recourse and credit-invisible make the product distinct from loans and credit cards. As an innovative financial product with distinct characteristics that do not fit within existing regulations, EWA requires a distinct regulatory framework. Currently, more than 100,000 workers in Delaware have already used Earned Wage Access services, which are mostly unregulated in the state. This bill helps ensure that responsible EWA providers can operate under the supervision of Delawareâs banking regulator and continue to serve users in the state of Delaware. Moreover, this bill codifies a regulatory framework that recognizes the distinct characteristics of EWA products and will keep Delawareans protected from bad actors who might seek to use the âEarned Wage Accessâ moniker, while instead offering a predatory product. Specifically, this bill protects consumers in Delaware by creating a new Earned Wage Access provider license, issued by the Office of the State Bank Commissioner to companies whose products meet the following criteria, ensuring that: â¢	All users have at least one reasonable no-cost option for each transaction â¢	All fees and gratuities are clearly and transparently represented to users before they confirm their transactions â¢	EWA transactions are credit-invisible, that providers do not check a userâs credit before issuing EWA services, nor do they report to a credit agency if a user cancels their service â¢	EWA providers do not pursue recourse against users including charging interest, late fees, or sending unresolved EWA transactions to collections Author: Senator Mantzavinos
