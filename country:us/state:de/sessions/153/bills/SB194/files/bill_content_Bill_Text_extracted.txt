Legislation Document SPONSOR: Sen.Â Poore & Rep.Â Morrison Sen. Lockman; Rep. Osienski DELAWARE STATE SENATE 153rd GENERAL ASSEMBLY SENATE BILL NO. 194 AN ACT TO AMEND TITLE 19 OF THE DELAWARE CODE RELATING TO WAREHOUSE WORKER PROTECTIONS. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE: Section 1. Amend Title 19 of the Delaware Code by making deletions as shown by strike through and insertions as shown by underline as follows and by redesignating accordingly: Chapter 39. Warehouse Worker Protection Act. Â§ 3901. Declaration of purpose. The General Assembly finds that the rapid growth of just-in-time logistics and same-day or next-day consumer package delivery, and advances in technology used for tracking employee productivity, have led to a rise in the number of warehouse and distribution center workers who are subject to quantified work quotas. Warehouse and distribution center employees who work under those quotas are expected to complete a quantified number of tasks within specific time periods, often measured down to the minute or second, and face adverse employment action, including suspension or termination, if they fail to do so.Â Those quotas generally do not allow for workers to comply with safety guidelines or to recover from strenuous activity during productive work time, leaving warehouse and distribution center employees who work under them at high risk of injury and illness. The quotas under which warehouse and distribution center employees regularly work also affect their compensation. Warehouse and distribution center employees who work under a quota, however, do not receive the full benefit of minimum wages if their quota is increased to make up for the direct or indirect effect of a minimum-wage increase. Quotas in occupations that are already physically demanding not only increase accidents, but they also incentivize unsafe work. The workforce in warehouse and logistics who depend upon these jobs to provide for their families and often see no alternative but to prioritize quota compliance over their own safety. Â§ 3902.
